Description The disclosure of Japanese Patent Application No. 2002-278128 filed on Sep. 24, 2002 including the specification, drawings and abstract is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a slip control device of a four-wheel-drive vehicle to prevent slip of wheels by varying the torque transmission distribution on the front wheel side and the rear wheel side via a transfer clutch. 2. Description of the Related Art Statement Generally, a four-wheel-drive vehicle has an electromagnetic clutch disclosed in, for example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 7-25258, or a transfer clutch using a hydraulic-driven clutch, and a system capable of varying the torque distribution on front and rear wheels by varying the coupling force of the transfer clutch is known. The system using this transfer clutch performs the slip control to prevent any slip by varying the coupling force of the transfer clutch according to the differential rotation of the wheels when the slip occurs in any one of the front and rear, right and left wheels. However, in a conventional slip control system, a relatively large dead zone (a zone in which no control is performed) before starting the slip control is provided, and a problem occurs, in that the torque is abruptly changed if the slip control is started over the control starting slip quantity (over the dead zone), and the vehicle behavior is adversely affected. In order to prevent the slip in this case, it is necessary to control the coupling force of the transfer clutch in the direct coupling direction according to the differential rotation of the front and rear wheels. However, in order to prevent occurrence of any tight cornering brake phenomenon during the turn at a low speed, in other words, any brake phenomenon caused by the differential rotation attributable to the difference in the turning radius between the front and rear wheels, it is necessary to set the coupling force of the transfer clutch in the uncoupling direction when any differential rotation occurs between the front and rear wheels. If the above-described dead zone is simply narrowed, the differential wheel speed caused by the differential locus of the wheels during the turn at a very low speed is mistaken for the slip, the coupling force of the transfer clutch is controlled so as to be increased, and as a result, occurrence of the tight cornering brake phenomenon is promoted. OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a slip control device of a four-wheel-drive vehicle capable of preventing any abrupt torque change caused by the transfer to the slip control while preventing occurrence of any tight cornering brake phenomenon during the turn at a low speed. In a brief description of the slip control device of the four-wheel-drive vehicle in accordance with the present invention, when any one of the front and rear, right and left wheels is slipped, in a first area in which the wheel slip quantity is not exceeding a preset value, the indicated value to the coupling force of the transfer clutch calculated according to the slip quantity is corrected by the correction value according to the tight cornering brake quantity to perform the slip control, and when transferring to a second area in which the wheel slip quantity exceeds the preset value, the coupling force of the transfer clutch is controlled by the value of the indicated value in the first area added to the indicated value according to the slip quantity in the second area. Other characteristics and advantages of the present invention will be clarified by the following description. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 is a schematic block diagram of a system; FIG. 2 is a schematic representation of a control area of the slip control; FIG. 3 is a flowchart of the slip control processing; and FIG. 4 is a schematic representation of an example of a correction value map. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Firstly, a power transmission system of a four-wheel-drive vehicle will be described with reference to FIG. 1. In the figure, reference numeral 1 denotes an engine, and a transmission 2 is connected to an output shaft of the engine 1. A transfer 3 is integrally provided on a rear part of the transmission 2. The transfer 3 constitutes a center differential with a planetary gear mechanism 4 to which a driving force is input from the transmission 2, and with a transfer clutch 5 comprising a multiple disc clutch which is provided to the planetary gear mechanism 4. The coupling force (the coupling torque) of the multiple disc clutch is electronically controlled by a transfer control unit 20 which will be described below, and after the output of the engine 1 is shifted to a predetermined gear by the transmission 2, the driving force is distributed to the front wheel side and the rear wheel side via the transfer 3. In the present embodiment, the output side of the transmission 2 is connected to a ring gear of the planetary gear mechanism 4, and a carrier to rotatable support a pinion engaged with the ring gear and a sun gear is connected to a rear differential 7 via a propeller shaft 6. A carrier of the planetary gear mechanism 4 is connected to a clutch drum of the transfer clutch 5, the sun gear is connected to a clutch hub of the transfer clutch 5, and also connected to a front differential 9 via a front drive shaft 8. The transfer clutch 5 has a drive mechanism for pressing an attachable/detachable clutch plate disposed in a row between the clutch drum and the clutch hub via the carrier, for example, an electromagnetic mechanism comprising an electromagnetic clutch and a torque amplifying cam, and the coupling torque is controlled by controlling the exciting current of the electromagnetic mechanism. Then, the driving force input from the transmission 2 to the planetary gear mechanism 4 is transmitted to right and left rear wheels 11R and 11L from the carrier via the rear differential 7, and the differential output between the carrier and the sun gear according to the coupling force of the transfer clutch 5 is transmitted to the right and left front wheels 10R and 10L via the front differential 9. In other words, when the transfer clutch 5 is completely coupled, the carrier and the sun gear are integrally fixed to uniformly distribute the torque to the front wheel side and the rear wheel side, while the torque is disproportionately distributed to the rear wheels when the transfer clutch 5 is in a released condition. The coupling torque of the transfer clutch 5 is electronically controlled by the transfer control unit 20 mainly comprising a microcomputer. This transfer control unit 20 receives each signal from various kinds of sensors and switches to detect the engine running condition and a vehicle traveling condition, and operates the indicated value of the coupling torque of the transfer clutch 5 based on these signals. As shown in FIG. 1, the transfer control unit 20 receives the signals from a wheel speed sensor 21FR to detect the wheel speed of a right front wheel 10R, a wheel speed sensor 21FL to detect the wheel speed of a left front wheel 10L, a wheel speed sensor 21RR to detect the wheel speed of a right rear wheel 11R, a wheel speed sensor 21RL to detect the wheel speed of a left rear wheel 11L, a throttle position sensor 22 to detect a position of a throttle valve of the engine 1, a steering angle sensor 23 to detect the rotational angle (the steering angle) of a steering wheel, a G sensor 24 to detect the lateral acceleration of a vehicle, a yaw rate sensor 25 to detect a rotational angular velocity (the yaw rate) in the yaw direction of the vehicle, and the like. In such a control of the coupling torque of the transfer clutch 5, if a slip occurs in any one of front and rear, and right and left wheels, the control is transferred from the normal control to the slip control. In this slip control, contrary to the conventional control to start the slip control by providing a dead zone before the differential rotation reaches a predetermined value, the dead zone area is defined as a first slip control area, the coupling torque according to the slip quantity is led in a proportional control manner, and the slip control area is smoothly transferred to a slip control area after the dead zone (the second slip control area) while preventing occurrence of tight cornering brake phenomena during a large steering wheel turn at a low vehicle speed as shown in FIG. 2. More specifically, the temporary indicated torque is obtained with the value proportional to the differential rotation between wheels as the maximum value in the first slip control area, and occurrence of a tight cornering brake phenomenon is prevented by correcting this temporary indicated torque by the correction value according to the tight cornering brake quantity to be an indicated torque of the transfer clutch 5. In the slip control area after the dead zone (the second slip control area), by performing the slip control with the total value of the indicated torque according to the slip quantity and the indicated torque in the first slip control area as the indicated torque, smooth transfer from the first slip control area to the second slip control area can be realized, and abrupt torque change is prevented to stabilize the vehicle behavior. The slip control processing by the transfer control unit 20 will be described with reference to the flowchart shown in FIG. 3. In this slip control processing, it is firstly examined in step S101 whether or not differential rotation between wheels above a detectable level occurs based on the signals from the wheel speed sensors 21FR, 21FL, 21RR and 21RL. As a result, if no differential rotation occurs, the process escapes from step S101, and proceeds to another indicated torque calculation routine to operate the indicated torque according to the running condition of the vehicle, and if differential rotation occurs, the process proceeds from step S101 to step S102 or subsequent steps. In step S102, it is examined whether or not the present control area is the second slip control area. If the present control area is not the second slip control area, the process proceeds from step S102 to step S103 to set the present control to be a temporary first slip control, and the temporary indicated torque (the temporary first slip control indicated torque) SVPTQ1 in this temporary first slip control is calculated as the indicated torque proportional to the differential rotation. Next, the process proceeds to step S104, and the correction value TQVGN in order to correct the temporary first slip control indicated torque SVPTQ1 according to the tight cornering brake quantity is calculated with reference to a map (or a table). The correction value TQVGN has a value between 0.00 and 1.00, and used as a multiplication term to the temporary first slip control indicated torque SVPTQ1. In other words, occurrence of the tight cornering brake phenomenon is prevented by correcting the coupling torque of the transfer clutch 5 so as to be reduced and increasing torque distribution on the rear wheel side the more, as the correction value TQVGN is the smaller. More specifically, the correction value TQVGN will be obtained by estimating the tight cornering brake quantity and preparing the data map (or the table) in advance by the simulation or experiments taking the vehicle speed, the lateral acceleration and the yaw rate as basic parameters as shown in (1) to (14) below, and based on the parameters with the wheel speed ratio, the throttle position, the steering angle or the like added to the above parameters, and referring to the data map (or the table) with interpolation. (1) Calculate the correction value based on the vehicle speed and the right-to-left wheel speed ratio. FIG. 4 shows an example of a correction value data map with the vehicle speed and the right-to-left wheel speed ratio as parameters, and the correction value TQVGN is calculated by performing four-point interpolation of lattice points. In this map, the higher the vehicle speed is, the closer the correction value TQVGN is brought to 1.00, and the smaller the correction value to the temporary first slip control indicated torque SVTPQ1 is. Contrary to this, in a low vehicle speed area, the characteristic is set so that the farther the right-to-left wheel speed ratio is from a center value (1.0; for straight running), the smaller the correction value TQVGN is, and the more the correction value to the temporary first slip control indicated torque SVTPQ1 is. Further, the map is set so that the correction value is smaller as countermeasures for the fuel consumption when the vehicle speed is much higher than the high vehicle speed. (2) Calculate the correction value based on the vehicle speed and the front-to-rear wheel speed ratio. Substantially similar to (1) above, the lower the vehicle speed is and the larger the front-to-rear wheel speed ratio is, the smaller the correction value TQVGN is set, and the degree of correction to the temporary first slip control indicated torque SVTPQ1 is intensified, and the coupling torque of the transfer clutch 5 is corrected to be smaller. (3) Calculate the correction value based on the wheel speed ratio and the vehicle speed by employing the value of the right-to-left front wheel speed ratio (the inner wheel/the outer wheel) and the right-to-left rear wheel speed ratio (the inner wheel/the outer wheel), whichever is the smaller (whichever is the larger in the case of the outer wheel/the inner wheel) as the wheel speed ratio. In comparison with the cases of (1) and (2), correcter control is possible to the slip during the curve traveling with the inner/outer wheel difference occurring therein, and the lower the vehicle speed is and the larger the wheel speed ratio is, the smaller the correction value TQVGN is set, the degree of correction to the temporary first slip control indicated torque SVTPQ1 is intensified, and the coupling torque of the transfer clutch 5 is corrected to be smaller. (4) Calculate the correction value based on the vehicle speed and the throttle position. The lower the vehicle speed is and the larger the throttle position is, the smaller the correction value TQVGN is set, the degree of correction to the temporary first slip control indicated torque SVTPQ1 is intensified, and the coupling torque to the transfer clutch 5 is corrected to be smaller. (5) Calculate the correction value based on the vehicle speed and the steering angle. The smaller the vehicle speed is and the larger the steering angle is, the smaller the correction value TQVGN is set, the degree of correction to the temporary first slip control indicated torque SVTPQ1 is intensified, and the coupling torque of the transfer clutch 5 is corrected to be smaller. (6) Calculate the correction value based on only the vehicle speed. The smaller the vehicle speed is, the smaller the correction value TQVGN is set, the degree of correction to the temporary first slip control indicated torque SVTPQ1 is intensified, and the coupling torque of the transfer clutch 5 is corrected to be smaller. (7) Calculate the correction value based on the lateral acceleration and the front-to-rear wheel speed ratio. The larger the lateral acceleration is and the smaller the front-to-rear wheel speed ratio is, the smaller the correction value TQVGN is set, the degree of correction to the temporary first slip control indicated torque SVTPQ1 is intensified, and the coupling torque of the transfer clutch 5 is corrected to be smaller. (8) Calculate the correction value based on the lateral acceleration and the right-to-left wheel speed ratio. The larger the lateral acceleration is and the smaller the right-to-left wheel speed ratio is, the smaller the correction value TQVGN is set, the degree of correction to the temporary first slip control indicated torque SVTPQ1 is intensified, and the coupling torque of the transfer clutch 5 is corrected to be smaller. (9) Calculate the correction value based on the wheel speed ratio and the lateral acceleration by employing the right-to-left front wheel speed ratio (the inner wheel/the outer wheel) and the right-to-left rear wheel speed ratio (the inner wheel/the outer wheel), whichever is the smaller (however, whichever is the larger in the case of the outer wheel/the inner wheel) as the wheel speed ratio. In comparison with (7) and (8) above, correcter control is possible for the slip when the vehicle is running on a curve with the inner/outer wheel difference occurring therein, and the larger the lateral acceleration is and the smaller the wheel speed ratio is, the smaller the correction value TQVGN is set, the degree of correction to the temporary first slip control indicated torque SVTPQ1 is intensified, and the coupling torque of the transfer clutch 5 is corrected to be smaller. (10) Calculate the correction value based on the lateral acceleration and the steering angle. The larger the lateral acceleration is and the larger the steering angle is, the smaller the correction value TQVGN is set, the degree of correction to the temporary first slip control indicated torque SVTPQ1 is intensified, and the coupling torque of the transfer clutch 5 is corrected to be smaller. (11) Calculate the correction value based on the yaw rate and the front-to-rear wheel speed ratio. The larger the yaw rate is and the smaller the front-to-rear wheel speed ratio is, the smaller the correction value TQVGN is set, the degree of correction to the temporary first slip control indicated torque SVTPQ1 is intensified, and the coupling torque of the transfer clutch 5 is corrected to be smaller. (12) Calculate the correction value based on the yaw rate and the right-to-left wheel speed ratio. The larger the yaw rate is and the smaller the right-to-left wheel speed ratio is, the smaller the correction value TQVGN is set, the degree of correction of the temporary first slip control indicated torque SVTPQ1 is intensified, and the coupling torque of the transfer clutch 5 is corrected to be smaller. (13) Calculate the correction value based on the wheel speed ratio and the yaw rate by employing the right-to-left front wheel speed ratio (the inner wheel/the outer wheel) and the right-to-left rear wheel speed ratio (the inner wheel/the outer wheel), whichever is the smaller (however, whichever is the larger in the case of the outer wheel/the inner wheel) as the wheel speed ratio. In comparison with (11) and (12) above, corrector control is possible to the slip when the vehicle is running on a curve with the inner/outer wheel difference occurring therein, and the larger the yaw rate is and the smaller the wheel speed ratio is, the smaller the correction value TQVGN is set, the degree of correction to the temporary first slip control indicated torque SVTPQ1 is intensified, and the coupling torque of the transfer clutch 5 is corrected to be smaller. (14) Calculate the correction value based on the yaw rate and the steering angle. The larger the yaw rate is and the larger the steering angle is, the smaller the correction value TQVGN is set, the degree of correction to the temporary first slip control indicated torque SVTPQ1 is intensified, and the coupling torque of the transfer clutch 5 is corrected to be smaller. If a sensor or the like to detect the above parameters is failed, the correction value TQVGN is set to be constant. However, the control in the first slip control area is preferably stopped with TQVGN=0. As described above, after calculating the correction value TQVGN to the temporary first slip control indicated torque SVTPQ1 , the process proceeds from step S104 to step S105, multiply the temporary first slip control indicated torque SVTPQ1 by the correction value TQVGN to calculate the first slip control indicated torque, and exits the routine. This first slip control indicated torque is calculated for the front and rear wheel slip, the right and left front wheel slip, and right and left rear wheel slip, and the maximum value thereof is used for the indicated coupling torque of the transfer clutch 5, the temporary first slip control indicated torque SVTPQ1 which is obtained in a proportional control manner according to the slip quantity in the dead zone area is corrected by the correction value TQVGN, and occurrence of any tight cornering brake phenomenon during the turn at a low speed can be prevented. Then, the control is transferred from the first slip control area to the second slip control area, and the process proceeds from step S102 to step S106. The indicated torque (the second slip control indicated torque) SVPTQ2 in the second slip control area is calculated as a value of the indicated torque in the first slip control area added to the indicated torque according to the slip quantity, and the process exits the routine. In the second slip control area, the slip is suppressed by the differential control by adding the indicated torque portion (the temporary first slip control indicated torque SVTPQ1 or the corrected first slip control indicated torque SVTPQ1.times.TQVGN) in the first slip control area to the target value while the indicated torque obtained by the simulation or experiments or the like in advance according to the differential rotation. As described above, in the present embodiment, the slip control is performed in a proportional control manner according to the slip quantity in the dead zone area in a conventional slip control in advance, and smoothly transferred to the slip control after passing the dead zone. As a result, different from a conventional system, the torque is not changed abruptly from the dead zone area, and instability of the vehicle behavior accompanied by the transfer to the slip control can be prevented. In addition, in the slip control in the dead zone area, correction is performed according to the tight cornering brake quantity, and degradation of the ride quality caused by occurrence of tight cornering brake phenomena during the turn at a low speed can be prevented. In the present invention, it is to be clearly understood that various modifications may be constituted in the broadest interpretation within the spirit and scope of the invention. The present invention is not limited by specified embodiments thereof unless limited by the appended claims. * * * * *",

            "fullText":"  ( 1 of 1 ) United States Patent 7,041,025 Yamada May 9, 2006 Manual transmission for four-wheel drive vehicle Abstract A manual transmission for a four-wheel drive vehicle transmits a power to a front drive shaft for driving front wheels and to a rear drive shaft for driving rear wheels through a propeller shaft. A plurality of shift gear trains are formed by drive gears mounted on an input shaft, driven gears meshing with the drive gears and mounted on an output shaft arranged below the input shaft and clutches. The output shaft is hollowed inside to incorporate the front drive shaft therein. An intermediate shaft is rotatably, coaxially disposed with the input shaft and is driven by the output shaft through a connection gear train. The intermediate shaft is coaxially connected with a transfer unit from which power is distributed to the front drive shaft through another connection gear train and at the same time to the rear drive shaft. Further, the transmission incorporates another clutch for directly transmitting power from the input shaft to the intermediate shaft so as to produce a shift gear ratio of 1.0.

The transmission according to claim 4, wherein said output shaft is disposed below said input shaft, and incorporates said front drive shaft therein. Description BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a manual transmission for a four-wheel drive vehicle capable of transmitting an engine power to both front and rear wheels of a vehicle. 2. Discussion of Related Arts Generally, a manual transmission comprises an input Shaft inputting engine power through a clutch, a plurality of drive gears mounted on the input shaft, an output shaft and a plurality of driven gears constantly meshing with the respective drive gears, forming a plurality of shift gear trains between the input and output shafts. Further, the manual transmission has clutches such as synchromesh mechanisms for changing over the engagement of the respective gear trains between a power transmission condition and a power shut-off condition and when a driver operates a shift lever, the clutches are actuated to change over either of the gear trains to a power transmission condition. The manual transmission for a four-wheel drive vehicle has a front drive shaft provided coaxially in a hollow output shaft and connected with a front final reduction gear apparatus or a front differential and a rear drive shaft connected with a rear final reduction gear apparatus or a rear differential through a propeller shaft. Further, the transmission has a power distribution apparatus or a transfer unit for distributing power between the front drive shaft and the rear drive shaft. The power distribution apparatus can change a power distribution ratio of front wheels to rear wheels of driving force, when drive wheels slip on a road surface with low friction coefficient or when there occurs a difference of rotation by more than a specified value between the front wheels and the rear wheels. In a conventional manual transmission for a four wheel drive vehicle in which the output shaft is disposed below the input shaft, the power distribution apparatus is disposed coaxially with the output shaft at the rear of the output shaft. In thus layouted transmission, a large thrust load is applied from an orthogonal gear of the front final reduction gear to bearings for supporting the output shaft through the front drive shaft. As a result, not only the bearings are needed to be up-sized, a large power loss generates in the bearings due to the large thrust load applied thereto. Further, the up-sizing of the bearings itself generates a larger rotational loss. Hence, this type of the manual transmission has a difficulty in enhancing an efficiency of power transmission. On the other hand, lubrication oil is accommodated in the transmission case in order to lubricate meshing surfaces of the gears and sliding surfaces of the shafts. When a vehicle travels, the lubrication oil is splashed by rotating gears and is supplied to required parts of the transmission. In case where the power distribution apparatus is coaxially disposed with the output shaft as described above, the power transmission apparatus is positioned at the lower part of the transmission. Hence, since the lubrication oil is agitated, while a large part of the power distribution apparatus is dipped in under the static oil level, a larger agitation resistance is exerted on the output shaft. To solve this problem, Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. Toku-Kai-Hei 10-166877 discloses a manual transmission for a four wheel drive vehicle in which an output shaft is coaxially disposed with a first input shaft connected to an engine and a second input shaft connected with the first input shaft through gears is arranged below the output shaft and a plurality of gear trains are provided between the output shaft and the second input shaft. The advantage of this transmission is that the power distribution apparatus can be disposed coaxially with the output shaft above the second input shaft and since the power distribution apparatus is located in a position higher than the oil level, the agitation resistance in the power distribution apparatus can be reduced. However, in this type of the transmission, since a front drive shaft is incorporated in a hollow second input shaft, there always exists a rotational difference between the second input shaft and the output shaft, except when the first input shaft is directly connected with the output shaft in a fourth gear position. That is, since the front drive shaft slides around the second input shaft with a working load of gear applied to both shafts, a loss of power transmission is generated on the sliding surface. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is an object of the present invention to provide a manual transmission in which there is no relative rotation between the hollow shaft and the front drive shaft inside of the hollow shaft, when a vehicle travels straightforwardly. It is another object of the present invention to enhance an efficiency of power transmission by reducing loads exerted from an orthogonal gear of a front final reduction gear on the bearings. It is further object of the present invention to reduce agitation resistance of lubrication oil in the power distribution apparatus. In order to achieve the objects, a manual transmission of a four-wheel drive vehicle having a front drive shaft for driving front wheels and a rear drive shaft for driving rear wheels, comprises an input shaft for inputting an engine power, a plurality of shift drive gears mounted on the input shaft, an output shaft hollowed inside and provided below the input shaft and incorporating the front drive shaft therein, a plurality of shift driven gears mounted on the output shaft and meshing with the shift driven gears, a plurality of shift gear trains formed by the shift drive gears and the shift driven gears meshing with the shift drive gears between the input and output shafts, a plurality of clutches for changing over the shift gear trains between a power transmitting condition and a power shut-off condition, an intermediate shaft disposed rotatably, coaxially with the input shaft, a first connection drive gear integrally mounted on the output shaft, a first connection driven gear integrally mounted on the intermediate shaft and meshing with the first connection drive gear, a second connection drive gear integrally mounted on the intermediate shaft, a second connection driven gear integrally mounted on the front drive shaft and meshing with the second connection drive gear, and a power distributing apparatus coaxially connected with the intermediate shaft and coaxially connected with the rear drive shaft for distributing a power transmitted from the intermediate shaft between the front drive shaft and the rear drive shaft. Further, the gears constituting the transmission are helical gears so as to generate an axial force to cancel the load from the orthogonal gear of the front final reduction gear unit.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT Referring now to FIG. 1, reference numeral 1 denotes an engine and reference numeral 2 denotes a clutch and reference numeral 3 denotes a manual transmission. The transmission 3 inputs power from the engine 1 through the clutch 2 and transmits the power to a front wheel 4a through a front wheel final reduction gear unit 5 and a rear wheel 4b through a propeller shaft 6 and a rear wheel final reduction gear unit 7 to a rear wheel 4b, respectively. The respective final reduction gear units 5, 7 have a differential gear unit, respectively. The manual transmission 3 is a five-forward-speed transmission mounted on a vehicle in a longitudinal direction of the vehicle. Referring to FIG. 2, an input shaft 8 to which an engine power is inputted through a crankshaft 1a of the engine 1 and the clutch 2, and a hollow output shaft 9 arranged in parallel with and below the input shaft 8, are rotatably incorporated in a transmission case 3a, respectively. A drive gear 11 of the first gear ratio and a drive gear 12 of the second gear ratio are integrally mounted on the input shaft 8 and a drive gear 13 of the third gear ratio and a drive gear 15 of the fifth gear ratio are rotatably mounted thereon. On the other hand, a driven gear 21 of the first gear ratio and a driven gear 22 of the second gear ratio are rotatably mounted on the output shaft 9 and a driven gear 23 of the third gear ratio and a driven gear 25 of the fifth gear ratio are integrally mounted thereon. The drive gears 11, 12 of the input shaft 8 constantly mesh with the driven gears 21, 22 of the output shaft 9, respectively. Further, the drive gears 13, 15 of the input shaft 8 constantly mesh with the driven gears 23, 25 of the output shaft 9, respectively. Thus, a first speed gear train is formed by the drive gear 11 and the driven gear 21 and a second speed gear train is formed by the drive gear 12 and the driven gear 22. Similarly, a third speed gear train is formed by the drive gear 13 and the driven gear 23 and a fifth speed gear train is formed by the drive gear 15 and the driven gear 25. Further, an intermediate shaft 10 is rotatably, coaxially coupled with the rear part of the input shaft 8. A driven gear 14 for the fourth gear ratio is integrally mounted on the intermediate shaft 10 and constantly meshes with a drive gear 24 integrally mounted on the output shaft 9. The drive gear 24 is for transmitting a shift output other than the fourth gear ratio. A first clutch 31 is provided on the output shaft 9 to change over the gear train into either of the first speed gear train, the second speed gear train and the neutral position in which power is transmitted nowhere. Further, a second clutch 32 is provided on the input shaft 8 to change over the gear train into either the fifth speed gear train or the neutral position and a third clutch 33 is provided on the input shaft 8 to change over the gear train into either of the third speed gear train, the fourth speed gear train and the neutral position. The respective clutches are constituted by a synchromesh mechanism. The first clutch 31 has a synchronizer hub 31a secured to the output shaft 9 and a synchronizer sleeve 31b axially slidable so as to engage with splines 21a, 22a provided in the gears 21, 22, respectively. The second and third clutches 32, 33 have synchronizer hubs 32a, 33a secured to the input clutch 8 and synchronizer sleeves 32b, 33b so as to engage with splines 15a, 13a, 14a provided in the respective gears 15, 13, 14, respectively. A desired gear position is obtained by actuating the respective clutches when a driver operates a shift lever. A reverse drive gear 17 is integrally mounted on the input shaft 8 and a reverse driven gear 27 is mounted on a synchronizer sleeve 31b. Further, an idler gear (not shown) is axially slidably mounted on an idler shaft (not shown) and when the idler gear engages with the drive gear 17 and the driven gear 27, the rotation of the input shaft 8 is reversely transmitted to the output shaft 9. The axial movement of the idler gear is performed by an operation mechanism (not shown). When gear positions other than the fourth gear ratio, that is, the first gear ratio, the second gear ratio, the third gear ratio and the fifth gear ratio, are established, the engine power inputted to the input shaft 8 is transmitted to the output shaft 9 and further transmitted to the intermediate shaft 10 through the connection gear train 24, 14. When the fourth gear ratio is selected, the input shaft 8 is directly connected with the intermediate shaft 10 by the clutch 33 and the engine power is transmitted directly from the input shaft 8 to the intermediate shaft 10. A front drive shaft 34 is rotatably, coaxially incorporated in the hollow output shaft 9 and has an orthogonal gear 35 at the front end thereof. The orthogonal gear 35 meshes with a reduction gear 36 to transmit power to a front wheel 4a. The intermediate shaft 10 is connected with a power distribution apparatus (hereinafter, referred to as transfer unit) 40 constituted by a center differential unit comprising a planetary gear train 41 and a multiple disc clutch 42. The transfer unit 40 has a drive gear 38 meshing with a driven gear 37 integrally formed with a rear end of the front drive shaft 34. That is, a front drive gear train is formed by these gears 37, 38. Further, the transfer unit 40 has a rear drive section 39 connected to the propeller shaft 6. When a rotational difference occurs between front and rear wheels, the rotational difference is absorbed by a differential rotation of the planetary gear train. Thus, since the transfer unit 40 is mounted on the intermediate shaft 10 arranged above the output shaft 9, the oil level of lubrication oil accommodated in a transmission case 3a is in a lower position than the transfer unit 40, the miscellaneous rotating components in the transfer unit 40 never agitates the lubrication oil and as a result the agitation resistance applied to the transfer unit 40 can be reduced, whereby the fuel economy is enhanced. The gear ratio of the connection gear train formed by the driven gear 14 and the drive gear 24 and that of the front drive gear train formed by the driven gear 38 and the driven gear 37 are equal to 1.0 respectively. Accordingly, the rotation speed of the intermediate shaft 10 is equal to that of the output shaft 9 over all gear positions. When the vehicle travels straightforwardly, since there is no differential rotation in the transfer unit 40, the output shaft 9 rotates integrally with the front drive shaft 34 incorporated in the output shaft 9 and there is no sliding motion between both shafts. Whereby, the friction loss between the output shaft 9 and the front drive shaft 34 can be prevented. Referring to FIG. 4, the front drive shaft 34 is rotatably supported at the front end thereof by the transmission case 3a through an angular contact type ball bearing 51 and the output shaft 9 incorporating the front drive shaft therein is rotatably supported at the rear end thereof by the transmission case 3a through a roller bearing 52. A needle thrust bearing 53 is provided at the front end of the output shaft 9 in order to bear a thrust load from the front drive shaft 34. As shown in FIG. 3, an axial force is applied in a direction marked A from the front final reduction gear unit 5 to the front drive shaft 34 through the orthogonal gear 35 and further applied to the angular contact type ball bearing 51. On the other hand, an axial force is applied from the power transmission gear trains to the thrust bearing 53 of the output shaft 9. When the vehicle travels straightforwardly, since there is no relative rotation between the output shaft 9 and the front drive shaft 34, the durability of the bearing can be enhanced. The shift gear trains from the first to fifth gear ratios, the connection gear train and the front drive gear train, are constituted by helical gears. When a certain pair of gears are transmitting power, a component force as indicated by an arrow B in FIG. 3 is exerted on the teeth flank of working gears in a reverse direction to the arrow A. Accordingly, a reaction force is exerted on the output shaft 9 in a direction canceling the axial force A originating from the front final reduction gear unit 5. As a result, the axial load applied to the bearing 51 is reduced and a ball bearing can be used instead of a tapered roller bearing. As a result, the power transmission efficiency is enhanced and the fuel economy goes up. As shown in FIG. 4, the front drive shaft 34 is constituted by two portions, a portion 34a on which the orthogonal gear 35 is provided and a portion 34b on which the driven gear 37 is provided and these two portions are coupled with each other by a serration 30. The driven gear 37 is supported at the front end thereof by the rear end of the output shaft 9 through a thrust bearing. FIG. 5 is a skeleton diagram showing a manual transmission for a four-wheel drive vehicle according to another embodiment of the present invention. This transmission has six forward speeds. In the transmission, drive gears 11, 12, 13, 14 and 16 are mounted on the input shaft 8 for first, second, third, fourth gear ratios respectively and driven gears 21, 22, 23, 24 and 26 constantly meshing with the drive respective gears are mounted on the output shaft 9. A connection gear train is formed by a driven gear 15 integrally mounted on the intermediate shaft 10 and a drive gear 25 integrally mounted on the output shaft 9. The gear ratio of the connection gear train is 1.0. The second clutch 32 changes over the shift gear train between the third gear ratio and the fourth gear ratio and the third clutch 33 changes over the gear train between the fifth gear ratio and the sixth gear ratio. The transmission according this embodiment has a similar structure to that shown in FIG. 1 except for the number of shift gear trains. The components of the transmission which are identical in both drawings FIG. 2 and FIG. 5 are denoted by identical reference numbers. FIG. 6 is a skeleton diagram showing a manual transmission for a four-wheel drive vehicle according to a further embodiment of the present invention. The components identical in both drawings FIG. 1 and FIG. 6 are denoted by identical reference numbers. This transmission has five forward speed ratios in the same way as that shown in FIG. 2. The transfer unit 40 is formed only by a multiple disc clutch or a viscous coupling 42 but has no center differential unit. The intermediate 10 is connected at the rear end thereof with a rear drive section 39. Further, the rear drive section 39 is connected at the rear end thereof with the propeller shaft 6. Also in the transmissions shown in FIG. 5 and FIG. 6, in the same manner as the transmission shown in FIG. 2, since the transfer unit 40 is coaxially coupled with the input shaft 8 and is disposed above the output shaft 9, the agitating resistance of lubrication oil is prevented from being exerted on the output shaft 9. Further, since a large axial force is prevented from being applied to the bearing for supporting the front drive shaft 34, the power transmission efficiency can be enhanced. Further, when the vehicle travels straightforwardly, since a relative rotation does not generate between the output shaft 9 and the front drive shaft 34 incorporated in the output shaft 9, the power transmission efficiency can be raised.

Description BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a differential apparatus for an automobile, more particularly, to an art which can be effectively applied to a differential apparatus having a limited slip differential mechanism. 2. Related Art A power train of an automobile for transmitting an engine output to driving wheels comprises various devices such as a start clutch, a transmission, a propeller shaft, and a differential apparatus. A rotational driving force transmitted from the engine to the differential apparatus is distributed to each driving wheel depending on the driving condition of the automobile. A differential apparatus includes a differential mechanism which enables a smooth driving of the automobile by absorbing a rotational speed difference between the right and left driving wheels when the automobile negotiates curves. The differential mechanism comprises a gear case which is driven by a rotational driving force from the engine, two side gears housed in the gear case and connected to the driving wheels through drive shafts, and two pinion gears which rotate around a pinion shaft fixed on the differential case and mesh with the two side gears. In the gear case, since the pinion gears rotate around a pinion shaft depending on the rotational speed difference between the two side gears, the rotation of the side gears and the driving torque transmitted by the side gears are increased or decreased depending on the rotational resistances applied on them. The differential apparatus can be used to distribute the rotational driving force of the engine to the right and left driving wheels of front and rear axles, and to distribute the rotational driving force of the engine to the front and rear axles in the transmission. Since the differential apparatus distributes the rotational driving force depending on the driving resistances applied on the driving wheels, when one of the driving wheels slips on a snowy or icy road, almost all of the driving power is distributed to the driving wheel which is slipping on the road. As a result, the total rotational driving force for moving the automobile forward is inevitably reduced. Therefore, there has been developed a differential apparatus having a limited slip differential mechanism for limiting the differential rotation between two side gears to distribute the rotational driving force to the driving wheel which is not slipping on the road. Such limited slip differential mechanisms are divided into multiple types, including a mechanical friction type which controls a differential rotation using a mechanical friction torque, and a rotational-speed-sensitive type which controls a differential rotation using a viscous fluid which generates a fluidic resistive torque depending on a rotational speed difference between the differential case and the side gears. In a friction-type limited slip differential mechanism, the side gears and the pinion gears are formed as helical gears, such that the axial component of a meshing reaction force of the helical gears generates a frictional force between an end surface of the pinion gears and a differential case, and the radial component of the meshing reaction force generates a frictional force between tooth tops of the pinion gears and the differential case, to limit the differential function of the differential apparatus (see Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 101742/1994 (page 3, FIG. 1)). In another friction-type limited slip differential mechanism, side gears and pinion gears are formed as bevel gears, and tapered rings are interposed between the side gears and a differential case, respectively, such that the axial components of a meshing reaction force of the bevel gears are converted into larger frictional forces between end surfaces of the side gears and the differential case, to limit the differential function of the differential apparatus (see Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 82680/1999 (page 3, FIG. 1)). In a rotational-speed-sensitive-type limited slip differential mechanism, a side gear is connected to a differential case by a viscous coupling, such that a shear resistance of a viscous fluid in the viscous coupling is generated depending on a rotational speed difference between the side gear and the differential case, to limit the differential function of the differential apparatus. However, in the above-described limited slip differential mechanisms, the meshing reaction force and the shear resistance of the viscous fluid are the same in a drive mode, in which the rotational driving force is transmitted from the pinion gear to the side gear, and in a coast mode, in which the rotational driving force is transmitted from the side gear to the pinion gear. As a result, it is difficult to set a difference in the differential limiting forces between the drive mode, in which a driver of the automobile depresses an accelerator pedal, and the coast mode, in which the driver releases the accelerator pedal to apply an engine brake. Further, if the differential limiting force in the drive mode is reduced, the loss of a driving power deteriorates the acceleration performance of the vehicle when the vehicle starts or exits curve. Although the acceleration performance in the drive mode can be raised by increasing the differential limiting force in the drive mode, this, in turn, deteriorates the turning performance when the vehicle slows down and enters the curve due to the increase of the differential limiting force in the coast mode. Thus, it is difficult to raise the performance of the vehicle both in the drive mode and in the coast mode with the differential apparatus which generates the same differential limiting force in the drive mode and in the coast mode. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to improve the performance of an automobile by providing a differential apparatus having a limited slip differential mechanism which is capable of generating a larger difference between a differential limiting force in a drive mode and that in a coast mode. To achieve the above-mentioned object, according to a first aspect of the present invention, a differential apparatus for distributing a rotational driving force from a transmission output shaft to a first driving wheel and a nsecond driving wheel comprises: a first driving shaft connected to the first driving wheel; a second driving shaft connected to the second driving wheel; a driven gear disposed on the first driving shaft; and a driving gear which is positioned near the transmission output shaft to be meshed with the driven gear; wherein adjacent tooth surfaces of the driving gear are formed to have different pressure angles from each other, and a differential limiting force is generated by a meshing reaction force which is varied depending on a meshing direction of the driving gear. According to a second aspect of the present invention, the differential apparatus comprises: a differential case connected to the transmission output shaft; a first driving gear which is housed in the differential case to be meshed with a first driven gear disposed on the first driving shaft; a second driving gear which is housed in the differential case to be meshed with a second driven gear disposed on the second driving shaft; and an intermediate gear which is integrally disposed on the second driving gear to be meshed with the first driving gear. According to a third aspect of the present invention, the differential apparatus further comprises: a carrier which is connected to the second driving shaft to rotatably support the driving gear; and an intermediate gear which is integrally disposed on the driving gear to be meshed with an output gear disposed on the transmission output shaft. According to a 4th aspect of the present invention, the differential apparatus further comprises a differential case which houses the driving gear therein, and is connected to the transmission output shaft; wherein the driving gear is meshed with both the first driven gear connected to the first driving shaft, and the second driven gear connected to the second driving shaft. According to a 5th aspect of the present invention, a tooth surface of the driving gear for transmitting a rotational driving force in a drive mode is formed to have a larger pressure angle than that of a tooth surface to which the rotational driving force is transmitted during a coast mode. According to a 6th aspect of the present invention, the driving gear is formed in a cylindrical shape, and a differential limiting force is generated by a radial meshing reaction force which is applied to the driving gear. According to a 7th aspect of the present invention, the differential limiting force is a frictional force generated in the driving gear and a housing bore of the differential case housing the driving gear. According to an 8th aspect of the present invention, the differential limiting force is a frictional force generated in the driving gear and a support shaft of the carrier supporting the driving gear. According to a 9th aspect of the present invention, the driving gear, the first driven gear, and the second driven gear are formed as bevel gears, and a differential limiting force is generated by a meshing reaction force applied to the first and the second driven gears in a thrust direction. According to a 10th aspect of the present invention, a friction generating member is disposed between the first driven gear and the differential case, and a friction reducing member is disposed between the second driven gear and the differential case. According to an 11th aspect of the present invention, a first friction generating member is disposed between the first driven gear and the differential case, and a second friction generating member is disposed between the second driven gear and the differential case, the second friction generating member generating a smaller friction than that of the first friction generating member. According to a 12th aspect of the present invention, a larger meshing reaction force is applied to the first driven gear in a thrust direction in a drive mode, than that during a coast mode. According to a 13th aspect of the present invention, the friction generating member is a friction clutch. According to a 14th aspect of the present invention, the friction generating member is a tapered ring. In the differential apparatus according to the present invention, since adjacent tooth surfaces of the driving gear are formed to have different pressure angles from each other, different meshing reaction forces can be generated according to the meshing direction of the driven gear with the driving gear. Thus, a difference in differential limiting forces can be set by the meshing reaction forces. As a result, a large difference in the differential limiting forces can be set between a drive mode and a coast mode. For example, when a larger differential limiting force is set in a drive mode, while a smaller differential limiting force is set during a coast mode, contradictory performances of an automobile such as the turning performance and the acceleration performance can be made compatible with each other at high levels, so that the power performance of the automobile can be enhanced.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Embodiments of the present invention are described in detail herebelow with reference to the drawings. FIG. 1 is a skeleton view showing a manual transmission 12 of an automobile including differential apparatus 10 and 11 of one embodiment according to the present invention. As shown in FIG. 1, the manual transmission 12 includes an input shaft 14 connected to an engine 13, and an output shaft 15 as a transmission output shaft connected to driving wheels in parallel with the input shaft 14. These input shaft 14 and the output shaft 15 are housed in a transmission case 16 extending in a running direction of the automobile. The manual transmission 12 is disposed along a longitudinal axis of the automobile and comprises a power train of the four-wheel-drive automobile. A crank shaft 17 outputting an engine power is connected to the input shaft 14 through a start clutch 18. Transmission gears 21a and 22a for a first speed and a second speed are secured to the input shaft 14. Transmission gears 23a to 25a for a third speed to a fifth speed are rotatably attached to the input shaft 14. Transmission gears 21b and 22b for a first speed and a second speed are rotatably attached to the output shaft 15. Transmission gears 23b to 25b for a third speed to a fifth speed are secured to the output shaft 15. The driving transmission gears 21a to 25a disposed on the input shaft 14 are meshed with the driven transmission gears 21b to 25b disposed on the output shaft 15 so as to form speed change gear rows from a first speed to a fifth speed. When the speed change gear rows are shifted to a driving force transmitting mode, a synchro-meshing mechanism is actuated by the operation of a driver of the automobile. An engine power shifted through the speed change gear rows is inputted from the output shaft 15 to the center differential apparatus 10. A front wheel output shaft 30 connected to the output shaft 15 via the center differential apparatus 10 is housed in the hollow output shaft 15. The front differential apparatus 11 is connected to a front end of the front wheel output shaft 30 extending forward through the manual transmission 12. Front wheels and the front wheel output shaft 30 are connected to each other through the front differential apparatus 11. A rear wheel output shaft 31 connected to the output shaft 15 via the center differential apparatus 10 is connected to a rear wheel driving shaft 34 via two transmission gears 32, 33. The rear wheel driving shaft 34 extends rearward from the manual transmission 12, and is connected to rear wheels through a rear differential apparatus not shown. In this way, the shifted engine power is distributed to the front wheels and the rear wheels via the center differential apparatus 10, and is distributed to respective right and left wheels of the front or the rear wheels via the front differential apparatus 11 or the rear differential apparatus. FIG. 2 is a cross-sectional view of the front differential apparatus 11 shown in FIG. 1. The front differential apparatus 11 is an embodiment of the present invention. As shown in FIG. 2, the front differential apparatus 11 includes a differential case 36 to which a ring gear 35 is secured. In the differential case 36, side gears 37, 38 as driven gears are connected to the respective right and left driving wheels, and pinion gears 39, 40 as driving gears mesh with the side gears 37, 38. That is, the side gears 37, 38 serve as large differential gears, and the pinion gears 39, 40 serve as small differential gears. These side gears 37, 38 and the pinion gears 39, 40 are formed as cylindrical helical gears. The differential case 36 includes a case body 36a and a case cover 36b. The case body 36a houses therein side gears 37, 38, and the pinion gears 39, 40. The ring gear 35 is secured to the case cover 36b. The ring gear 35 is disposed to mesh with a drive pinion gear 41 disposed on a front end of the front wheel output shaft 30. Thus, the differential case 36 is rotationally driven by the rotational driving force transmitted from the output shaft 15 to the front wheel output shaft 30. The two side gears 37, 38 housed in the differential case 36 have hollow shaft portions 41, 42, respectively, and are rotatably supported on the differential case 36 at these shaft portions 41, 42. A fitting hole 43 is formed in an end surface of the side gear 37, while a fitting shaft 44 is formed in an opposed end surface of the side gear 38. Free ends of the side gears 37, 38 support each other by inserting the fitting shaft 44 in the fitting hole 43. Front wheel driving shafts 45, 46 as a first and a second driving shafts are spline-connected to the shaft parts 41, 42 of the respective side gears 37, 38. These front wheel driving shafts 45, 46 are rotatably secured to the differential case 36. The front wheel driving shaft 45 is connected to a left front wheel as a first driving wheel, while the front wheel driving shaft 46 is connected to a right front wheel as a second driving wheel. Thrust washers 47 and 48 are mounted between end surfaces of the side gears 37, 38 and the differential case 36. A thrust washer 49 is mounted between the two side gears 37, 38. As shown in FIG. 2, in the differential case 36a, a plurality of axially extending housing bores 50, 51 are formed radially outward the side gears 37, 38. The longer housing bore 50 and the shorter housing bore 51 are circumferentially adjacent to each other to form a pair of housing bores. A plurality of pairs of housing bores are circumferentially arranged with an equal gap therebetween. The pinion gears 39, 40 are rotatably housed respectively in the longer and shorter housing bores forming a pair of housing bores. The pinion gears 39, 40 are slidably held in the housing bores 50, 51 so as to contact with the inner peripheral surfaces of the housing bores 50, 51. The pinion gear 40 as the second driving gear housed in the longer housing bore 50 is disposed to mesh with the side gear 38 as the second driven gear. A pinion gear 53 as an intermediate gear is integrally disposed on the pinion gear 40 through a connecting shaft 52, the pinion gear 53 also being formed as a helical gear. The pinion gear 39 as the first driving gear housed in the shorter housing bore 51 is disposed to mesh with the pinion gear 53 and with the side gear 37 as the first driven gear. That is, the side gears 37, 38 are connected to each other through the three pinion gears 39, 40, and 53. When one side gear 37 is rotated, the other side gear 38 is reversely rotated through the three pinion gears 39, 40, and 53. A lubrication oil supply hole 54 passing through outside is formed in the differential case 36. With the rotation of the differential case 36, the lubrication oil in the transmission is supplied to the respective housing bores 50 and 51 so that the respective gears are lubricated. An operation of the front differential apparatus 11 is described below. When the differential case 36 is driven in rotation by the rotational driving force transmitted from the front wheel output shaft 30, the pinion gears 39, 40, and 53 held in the housing bores 50, 51 revolve together with the differential case 36. Since the revolutions of the pinion gears 39, 40, and 53 are transmitted to the two side gears 37, 38 meshing therewith, the rotation of the differential case 36 is transmitted to the driving wheels via the pinion gears 39, 40, and 53, and the side gears 37, 38. In this condition, the same driving torques are distributed to the right and left driving wheels. When the automobile negotiates curves or runs on a snowy or icy road, for example, respective rolling resistances applied on the right and left driving wheels are different from each other. Thus, the rotational speeds of the right or left driving wheels increase or decrease depending on the rolling resistances applied on them. Then, the two side gears 37, 38 relatively rotate by the differential rotations of the pinion gears 39, 40, and 53. Thus, a rotational speed of the driving wheel with a larger rolling resistance is decreased, while a rotational speed of the driving wheel with a smaller rolling resistance is increased. As a result, unnecessary slip of the driving wheels can be prevented, and a stable driving performance can be obtained. The front differential apparatus 11 can generate a differential limiting force which limits relative rotations of the side gears 37, 38 by limiting the differential rotations of the pinion gears 39, 40, and 53. Since the side gears 37, 38 and the pinion gears 39, 40 and 53 are formed as helical gears, these side gears and the pinion gears generate meshing reaction forces in thrust and radial directions. FIG. 3(A) is a schematic view showing a meshing reaction force generated in a thrust direction, and FIG. 3(B) is a schematic view showing a meshing reaction force generated in a radial direction. As shown in FIG. 3(A), by the meshing of the pinion gears 39, 40 and 53 with the side gears 37, 38, meshing reaction forces in a thrust direction indicated by the arrows are generated in the respective gears. These meshing reaction forces generate a frictional force between the housing bores 50, 51 of the differential case 36 and the end surfaces of the pinion gears 53 and 39 which provide a differential limiting force. Note that the thrust reaction force shown in FIG. 3(A) is generated when the differential case 36 is driven in rotation in the direction indicated by the arrow A shown in FIG. 2. As shown in FIG. 3(B), by the meshing of the pinion gears 39, 40 and 53 with the side gears 37, 38, meshing reaction forces in a radial direction indicated by the arrows are generated. These meshing reaction forces generate a frictional force between the housing bores 50, 51 of the differential case 36 and tooth tops of the pinion gears 39, 40 and 53 that provide the differential limiting force. FIG. 4 is a schematic view showing a meshing of the side gear 38 with the pinion gear 40 along the B--B line in FIG. 2. The arrows shown in FIG. 4 respectively indicate a direction to which the pinion gear 40 drives the side gear 38 in a drive mode in which the accelerator pedal is depressed to move the automobile forward, and a direction to which the side gears 38 drives the pinion gear 40 in a coast mode in which the accelerator pedal is released. As shown in FIG. 4, in the drive mode, since a rotational driving force is transmitted from the pinion gear 40 to the side gear 38, a tooth surface 40a of the pinion gear 40 and a tooth surface 38a of the side gear 38 are brought into contact with each other. On the other hand, in a coast mode, since a rotational driving force is transmitted from the side gear 38 to the pinion gear 40, a tooth surface 40b of the pinion gear 40 and a tooth surface 38b of the side gear 38 are brought into contact with each other. As shown in FIG. 4, a tooth shape of the pinion gear 40 as the driving gear is formed such that the pressure angles on the front surface and the rear surface are asymmetric. That is, the adjacent tooth surfaces 40a and 40b of the pinion gear 40 are formed to have different pressure angles from each other. Corresponding to the pinion gear 40, a tooth shape of the side gear 38 is formed such that the pressure angles of the tooth surface 38a and the tooth surface 38b are different from each other. The pressure angles of the tooth surfaces 38a and 40a which are brought into contact with each other in a drive mode are formed larger than the pressure angles of the tooth surfaces 38b and 40b which are brought into contact with each other during a coast mode. Not only the tooth shapes of the pinion gear 40 and the side gear 38, but also tooth shapes of the pinion gear 39 and the side gear 37 are formed such that pressure angles on the front surface and the rear surface are asymmetric in the same manner. A meshing reaction force in a radial direction generated by the meshing of the pinion gear 40 with the side gear 38 is described below. In the drive mode, since a rotational driving force is transmitted from the tooth surface 40a to the tooth surface 38a, a meshing reaction force in a radial direction is generated which is indicated by the arrow Dr shown in FIG. 4. On the other hand, in the coast mode, when a rotational driving force is transmitted from the tooth surface 38b to the tooth surface 40b, a meshing reaction force in a radial direction is generated which is indicated by the arrow Co. As shown in FIG. 4, in the drive mode, a radial reaction force Dr larger than a radial reaction force Co is generated by the meshing of the tooth surface 38a with the tooth surface 40a in which the larger pressure angles are set. On the other hand, in the coast mode, the radial reaction force Co smaller than the radial reaction force Dr is generated by the meshing of the tooth surface 38b with the tooth surface 40b in which the smaller pressure angles are set. As shown in FIG. 3(B), the radial reaction forces Dr and Co generate a differential limiting force between the housing bore 50 of the differential case 36 and the tooth top of the pinion gear. Thus, it is possible to create a difference between differential limiting forces in the drive mode and in the coast mode. As described above, in addition to the thrust reaction forces generated in the drive mode and in the coast mode, the larger radial reaction force Dr is generated in a drive mode, while the smaller radial reaction force Co is generated in the coast mode. Since these reaction forces generate differential limiting forces between the respective gears and the differential case 36, a larger differential limiting force can be set in the drive mode than the differential limiting force in the coast mode. When the differential limiting forces are set in this manner, contradictory performances of a automobile such as the turning performance and the acceleration performance can be made compatible with each other at high levels, so that the power performance of the automobile can be enhanced. That is, when the accelerator pedal is released for entering a curve or the like, a differential limiting force of the differential apparatus 11 can be decreased. As a result, factors which prevent turning of the automobile can be reduced, and thus the turning performance of the automobile such as turn-in crispness can be raised. When the differential limiting force in the coast mode is set to be small, the differential limiting force in the drive mode can be set to be large. Thus, when an accelerator pedal is depressed for starting or exiting a curve, the differential limiting force of the differential apparatus 11 can be increased. Thus, the loss of the driving torque transmitted to the driving wheels can be prevented so that stable acceleration performance can be realized. In addition, unnecessary differential limiting force can be reduced in the coast mode so as to improve fuel consumption. Since the reduction of the differential limiting force makes it possible to independently control the rotational speed and the driving torque of the driving wheels, a differential apparatus 11 that does not prevent the operation of an anti-lock brake system can be achieved. Further, the differential apparatus 11 needs no additional components, only the pressure angles of the pinion gears 39, 40 being asymmetrically formed. Thus, an increase of the cost for the differential apparatus 11 can be restrained, while enhancing the power performance of the automobile. FIG. 5 is a cross-sectional view showing the center differential apparatus 10 shown in FIG. 1. The center differential apparatus 10 is another embodiment of the present invention. As shown in FIG. 1, the center differential apparatus 10 is mounted among the output shaft 15, the front wheel output shaft 30, and the rear wheel output shaft 31 of the transmission. The center differential apparatus 10 distributes a rotational driving force to rear wheels as first driving wheels and front wheels as second driving wheels. The center differential apparatus 10 is a compound epicyclic or planetary gear type. A sun gear 60 as an output gear is disposed on an end of the output shaft 15 as a transmission output shaft. A sun gear 61 as a driven gear, i.e., a side gear, is disposed on the rear wheel output shaft 31 as a first driving shaft. A pinion gear 62 as an intermediate gear to be meshed with the sun gear 60 and a pinion gear 63 as a driving gear, i.e., a pinion gear to be meshed with the sun gear 61, are disposed radially outward from the sun gears 60 and 61. The pinion gears 62 and 63 are integrally disposed to form unitary pinion gears 64. The unitary pinion gears 64 are circumferentially arranged, and each of the unitary pinion gears 64 is rotatably supported by a carrier 65 through a support shaft 66. The front wheel output shaft 30 as the second driving shaft is connected to the carrier 65 through a hollow connecting shaft 67. Thus, the rotation of the carrier 65 directly provides the rotation of the front wheel output shaft 30. Although the pinion gears 62 and 63 are formed as cylindrical helical gears, they may be formed as spur gears. When a shifted rotational driving force is inputted from the output shaft 15 to the sun gear 60, driving torques are distributed to the carrier 65 and the rear wheel output shaft 31 according to meshing pitch radii of the sun gears 60 and 61 with the pinion gears 62 and 63. A rotational driving force is transmitted from the carrier 65 to the front wheels through the front wheel output shaft 30, and a rotational driving force is transmitted from the rear wheel output shaft 31 to the rear wheels through the rear wheel driving shaft 34. Since the unitary pinion gears 64 are rotated in a sun-and-planet manner, a rotational difference between the front wheels and rear wheels when the automobile turns can be differentially absorbed. Frictional members 68 and 69 are respectively disposed on both sides of the sun gear 61. The frictional members 68 and 69 connect the rear wheel output shaft 31 to the carrier 65 by means of a thrust force caused by the meshing of the sun gear 61. A differential limiting clutch 70 is disposed between the rear wheel output shaft 31 and the carrier 65. The differential limiting clutch 70 connects the rear wheel output shaft 31 to the carrier 65 by means of a spring force of a disc spring 70a. Since frictional forces generated in the frictional members 68 and 69 and a frictional force generated in the differential limiting clutch 70 control the relative rotations of the rear wheel output shaft 31 and the carrier 65, these frictional forces provide a differential limiting force for controlling planetary rotations of the unitary pinion gears 64. The illustrated center differential apparatus 10 distributes more driving torque to the rear wheels such that it resembles a rear wheel drive automobile. By limiting the planetary rotations of the unitary pinion gears 64, a ratio of a driving torque to be supplied to the front wheels can be increased. Similar to the above-described pinion gears 39, 40 of the front differential apparatus 11, a tooth shape of each of the pinion gears 62 and 63 housed in the center differential apparatus 10 is formed such that the pressure angles on the front surface and the rear surface are asymmetric. With respect to the tooth shapes of the sun gears 60 and 61 to be meshed with the pinion gears 62 and 63, the pressure angles are asymmetrically formed so as to correspond to the pinion gears 62 and 63. Among these pressure angles, the pressure angles on the respective tooth surfaces which are brought into contact with each other in a drive mode are formed larger than those on the respective tooth surfaces which are brought into contact with each other during a coast mode. In a drive mode, a rotational driving force is transmitted from the sun gear 60 to the sun gear 61 through the unitary pinion gears 64. During a coast mode, a rotational driving force is transmitted from the sun gear 61 to the sun gear 60 through the unitary pinion gears 64. Accordingly, in a drive mode, a larger radial meshing reaction force is applied to the unitary pinion gears 64, while during a coast mode, a radial meshing reaction force smaller than that in a drive mode is applied thereto. Since the radial reaction force increases a friction force at a contacting surface of internal diameters of the unitary pinion gears 64 and the support shaft 66, the radial reaction force provides such force that limits rotations of the unitary pinion gears 64 relative to the carrier 65. The limitation of the rotations of the unitary pinion gears 64 limits planetary rotations of the unitary pinion gears 64 going around the sun gears 60 and 61. Thus, a frictional force between the unitary pinion gears 64 and the support shaft 66 provides a differential limiting force. That is, a larger differential limiting force can be generated between the unitary pinion gears 64 and the support shaft 66 in a drive mode than that during a coast mode. By varying a differential limiting force of the center differential apparatus 10 between that in a drive mode and that in a coast mode, the differential limiting force of the differential apparatus can be reduced when an accelerator is off when entering a corner. Thus, a rotational difference between the front wheels and the rear wheels can be differentially absorbed so that the turning performance of the automobile can be improved. Especially, advantages of the center differential apparatus 10 of an epicyclical or planetary gear type, which has characteristics like those of a rear drive automobile by distributing unequal torques to the front and rear wheels, can be fully executed when driving in a turn. When an accelerator is on, such as in starting or escaping a corner, a differential limiting force of the differential apparatus can be increased. Thus, the planetary rotations of the unitary pinion gears 64 can be limited, so that a full rotational driving force is transmitted to the front wheels and the rear wheels. Thus, the stable acceleration performance found in a four-wheel drive automobile can be realized. FIG. 6 is a cross-sectional view showing a front differential apparatus 71 of another embodiment according to the present invention. As shown in FIG. 6, the front differential apparatus 71 includes a differential case 72 on which a ring gear 35 is secured. Side gears 73 and 74 and a pinion gear 75 are rotatably housed in the differential case 72. The side gears 73 and 74 as driven gears are respectively connected to right and left driving wheels. The pinion gear 75 as a driving gear is meshed with the side gears 73 and 74. These side gears 73 and 74, and the pinion gear 75 are formed as bevel gears. The differential case 72 has a case body 72a and a case cover 72b. The case body 72a houses therein a plurality of side gears 73 and 74 and a pinion gear 75. The ring gear 35 is secured on the case cover 72b. The ring gear 35 is disposed to mesh with a drive pinion gear 41 disposed on a top of the front wheel output shaft 30. Thus, the differential case 72 is driven in rotation by a rotational driving force transmitted from the output shaft 15 to the front wheel output shaft 30. The side-gears 73 and 74 as first and second driven gears housed in the differential case 72 respectively have spline holes 76 and 77 formed therein. Front wheel driving shafts 78 and 79 as first and second driving shafts are spline-connected to the spline holes 76 and 77, respectively. The front wheel driving shafts 78 and 79 are rotatably supported on the differential case 72. The front wheel driving shaft 78 is connected to a right front wheel as a first driving wheel, while the front wheel driving shaft 79 is connected to a left front wheel as a second driving wheel. A pinion shaft 80 is fitted in the case body 72a, and the pinion gear 75 is rotatably supported by the pinion shaft 80. The pinion gear 75 is disposed to mesh both the side gears 73 and 74. When one side gear 73 is rotated, the other side gear 74 is reversely rotated through the pinion gear 75. Multiple disc clutches 81 and 82 as friction generating members are disposed between the differential case 72 and the side gears 73 and 74. These multiple disc clutches 81 and 82 serve as frictional clutches, and respectively have a plurality of friction plates 81a and 82a and friction discs 81b and 82b which are alternately laid on each other. The friction plates 81a and 82a of the multiple disc clutches 81 and 82 are mounted in the differential case 72 in an axially movable manner, while the friction discs 81b and 82b are respectively mounted on the side gears 73 and 74 in an axially movable manner. An operation of the front differential apparatus 71 is described below. When the differential case 72 is driven in rotation by a rotational driving force transmitted from the front wheel output shaft 30, the pinion gear 75 supported by the pinion shaft 80 is revolved together with the differential case 72. Since the revolution of the pinion gear 75 is transmitted to the two side gears 73 and 74 which are meshed therewith, the rotation of the differential case 72 is transmitted to the driving wheels through the pinion gear 75 and the side gears 73 and 74. In this state, equal driving torques are distributed to the right and left driving wheels. When driving in a turn, since the side gears 73 and 74 are relatively rotatable, it is possible to decrease a rotational speed of a driving wheel having a larger rolling resistance, while increasing a rotational speed of a driving wheel having a smaller rolling resistance. Thus, a differential rotation between the driving wheels can be readily allowed, so that the stable turning performance can be realized. The front differential apparatus 71 can generate a differential limiting force because it limits relative rotations of the side gears 73 and 74. Next, processes of generating a differential limiting force are described. FIGS. 7(A) and 7(B) are schematic views showing a meshing condition of the pinion gear 75 with the side gears 73 and 74 shown from the arrow A in FIG. 6. FIG. 7(A) shows a meshing condition in a drive mode, and FIG. 7(B) shows a meshing condition during a coast mode. As shown in FIG. 7(A), a tooth shape of the pinion gear 75 as the driving gear is formed such that the pressure angles on the front surface and the rear surface are asymmetric. That is, adjacent tooth surfaces 75a and 75b of the pinion gear 75 are formed to have different pressure angles from each other. With respect to tooth shapes of the side gears 73 and 74, pressure angles of tooth surfaces 73a and 74a are formed different from those of tooth surfaces 73b and 74b to correspond to the pinion gear 75. In the pinion gear 75, a pressure angle of the tooth surface 75a is larger than that of the tooth surface 75b. Also in the side gears 73 and 74, pressure angles of the tooth surfaces 73a and 74a are larger than those of the tooth surfaces 73b and 74b. As shown in FIG. 7(A), in a drive mode when a rotational driving force is transmitted from the pinion gear 75 to the side gears 73 and 74, the rotational driving force is transmitted from the tooth surface 75a of the pinion gear 75 to the tooth surface 73a of the side gear 73 at the side of the side gear 73, while the rotational driving force is transmitted from the tooth surface 75b of the pinion gear 75 to the tooth surface 74b of the side gear 74 at the side of the side gear 74. At this time, a meshing reaction force in a thrust direction is generated in the side gear 73 which is indicated by the arrow Dr1 in FIG. 7(A), while a meshing reaction force in a thrust direction is generated in the side gear 74 which is indicated by the arrow Dr2. That is, in a drive mode, a larger thrust reaction force is applied to the side gear 73 relative to the side gear 74. As shown in FIG. 7(B), during a coast mode when a rotational driving force is transmitted from the side gears 73 and 74 to the pinion gear 75, the rotational driving force is transmitted from the tooth surface 73b of the side gear 73 to the tooth surface 75b of the pinion gear 75 at the side of the side gear 73, while the rotational driving force is transmitted from the tooth surface 74a of the side gear 74 to the tooth surface 75a of the pinion gear 75 at the side of the side gear 74. At this time, a meshing reaction force in a thrust direction is generated in the side gear 73 which is indicated by the arrow Co1 in FIG. 7(B), while a meshing reaction force in a thrust direction is generated in the side gear 74 which is indicated by the arrow Co2. That is, during a coast mode, a smaller thrust reaction force is applied to the side gear 73 relative to the side gear 74. As shown in FIG. 6, as compared with the multiple disc clutch 81 mounted between the side gear 73 and the differential case 72, the multiple disc clutch 82 mounted between the side gear 74 and the differential case 72 has fewer friction plates 82a and friction discs 82b. Thus, as compared with the multiple disc clutch 81 as a first friction generating member, a smaller frictional force, i.e., a transmission torque capacity, is set in the multiple disc clutch 82 as a second friction generating member. Therefore, in a drive mode, a larger thrust reaction force Dr1 is applied as a pressing force to the multiple disc clutch 81 having a larger transmission torque capacity, while a smaller thrust reaction force Dr2 is applied to the multiple disc clutch 82 having a smaller transmission torque capacity. On the other hand, during a coast mode, a smaller thrust reaction force Co1 is applied as a pressing force to the multiple disc clutch 81 having a larger transmission torque capacity, while a larger transmission thrust reaction force Co2 is applied to the multiple disc clutch 82 having a smaller transmission torque capacity. Accordingly, a frictional force generated in each of the multiple disc clutches 81 and 82, that is, a differential limiting force, becomes larger in a drive mode than during a coast mode. As a result, a larger differential limiting force can be generated in a drive mode than during a coast mode. Although the multiple disc clutch 82 having a smaller transmission torque capacity is disposed near the side gear 74, a friction reducing member such as a thrust bearing or thrust washer may be disposed thereon in place of the multiple disc clutch 82 as a friction generating member. In this way, a larger difference can be set between a differential limiting force in a drive mode and that during in a coast mode. Not limited to the multiple disc clutches 81 and 82, the friction generating member may be a disc clutch of wet type or dry type. In the disc clutch, an intensity of a frictional force can be varied by changing an outer dimension or inner diameter dimension. FIG. 8 is a cross-sectional view showing a differential apparatus 91 of another embodiment according to the present invention. In FIG. 8, the members common to those shown in FIG. 6 have the same reference numbers, and their detailed description is omitted. As shown in FIG. 8, two side gears 93 and 94 as first and second driven gears are rotatably housed in a differential case 92. Front wheel driving shafts 78 and 79 are respectively spline-connected to the side gears 93 and 94. The side gears 93 and 94 are formed as bevel gears. The side gears 93 and 94 respectively have teeth at one end surfaces thereof which are meshed with the pinion gear 75. A tapered surface 93a is formed at the other end surface of the side gear 93. A tapered surface 92a corresponding to the tapered surface 93a of the side gear 93 is formed at an inner periphery of the differential case 92 housing the side gear 93. A tapered ring 95 as a friction generating member is mounted between the side gear 93 and the differential case 92, the tapered ring 95 being capable of contacting the tapered surfaces 92a and 93a. A thrust washer 96 as a friction reducing member is mounted between the side gear 94 and the differential case 92. That is, at the side of the side gear 93, there is disposed the tapered ring 95 having a larger friction force, i.e., a larger transmission torque capability than the thrust washer 96. Similar to the front differential apparatus 71 shown in FIG. 6, tooth shapes of the pinion gear 75 and the side gears 93 and 94 have asymmetrical pressure angles. Thus, in a drive mode, a larger thrust reaction force is applied to the side gear 93, while during a coast mode, a larger thrust reaction force is applied to the side gear 94. Therefore, in a drive mode, a larger thrust reaction force is applied as a pressing force to the tapered ring 95 having a larger transmission torque capacity, while a smaller thrust reaction is applied to the thrust washer 96 having a smaller transmission torque capacity. On the other hand, during a coast mode, a smaller thrust reaction is applied to the tapered ring 95 having a larger transmission torque capacity, while a larger thrust reaction force is applied to the thrust washer 96 having a smaller transmission torque capacity. As a result, a friction force, i.e., a differential limiting force generated in the tapered ring 95, becomes larger in a drive mode than during a coast mode, so that a larger differential limiting force can be generated in a drive mode than during a coast mode. In place of the thrust washer 96 disposed near the side gear 94, a thrust bearing as a friction reducing member may be disposed thereon. Also, a tapered ring having a smaller transmission torque capacity than the tapered ring 95 disposed near the side gear 93 may naturally be disposed thereon. As described above, by employing the differential apparatus 10, 11, 71, and 91 respectively having the pinion gears 39, 40, 63, and 75 in which the adjacent tooth surfaces have different pressure angles from each other, a large difference can be set between differential limiting forces in a drive mode and during a coast mode. Specifically, when a larger differential limiting force is set in a drive mode, and a smaller differential limiting force is set during a coast mode, contradictory performances of an automobile such as the turning performance and the acceleration performance can be made compatible with each other at high levels, so that the power performance of the automobile can be enhanced. The differential apparatus 10, 11, 71, and 91 need no additional element, only the pressure angles of the pinion gears 39, 40, 63 and 75 being asymmetrically formed. Thus, an increase of the cost for the differential apparatus 10, 11, 71, and 91 can be restrained, while enhancing the power performance of the automobile. In addition, unnecessary differential limiting force can be reduced during a coast mode so as to improve fuel consumption, as well as the performance of an anti-lock brake system. Of course the present invention is not limited to the above embodiments, and various changes and modifications are possible without departing from the scope of the invention. For example, the front differential apparatus 11, 71, and 91 shown respectively in FIGS. 2, 6, and 8 may be used as rear differential apparatus for distributing a rotational driving force to the right and left rear wheels. Alternatively, the front differential apparatus 11, 71, and 91 may be used as center differential apparatus for distributing a rotational driving force to the front and rear wheels by changing a shape of the ring gear 35, or by inputting an output from a transmission to a differential case. Further, although the transmission shown in FIG. 1 is the manual transmission 12 for a four-wheel drive automobile, the manual transmission may be for a front-wheel drive automobile or a rear-wheel drive automobile. Not limited to a manual transmission, the differential apparatus according to the present invention may be housed in other transmission such as an automatic transmission or a continuous transmission. In addition, it has been described that an accelerator is on in a drive mode, while an accelerator is off during a coast mode. However, the driving mode and the coast mode are determined according to the meshed tooth surfaces of the respective gears. Thus, when an accelerator is depressed when reversing, for example, the same meshing reaction force as that during a coast mode as described above is naturally generated. According to the present invention, since adjacent tooth surfaces of the driving gear are formed to have different pressure angles from each other, different meshing reaction forces can be generated according to the meshing direction of the driven gear with the driving gear. Thus, a difference in differential limiting forces can be set by the meshing reaction forces. As a result, a large difference in the differential limiting forces can be set in a drive mode and during a coast mode. For example, when a larger differential limiting force is set in a drive mode, while a smaller differential limiting force is set during a coast mode, contradictory performances of an automobile such as the turning performance and the acceleration performance can be made compatible with each other at high levels, so that the power performance of the automobile can be enhanced.

Further, an actual differential rotation speed between front and rear drive shafts is calculated and a deviation between the target differential rotation speed and the actual differential rotation speed is calculated. Based on the deviation, a first differential limiting torque and based on a dial position of a variable dial a second differential limiting torque are calculated. Further, a third differential limiting torque is calculated based on the dial position and a throttle opening angle. A final differential limiting torque between front and rear drive shafts is obtained by summing up these first, second and third differential limiting torques.

Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a vehicular power distribution control apparatus and control method and more particularly to a control apparatus and method for controlling driving force to be transmitted from one drive shaft to the other drive shafts. 2. Discussion of Related Arts Generally, the power distribution control between front and rear wheels for four-wheel drive vehicles or the power distribution control between left and right wheels are performed by variably controlling an engagement force, namely a differential limiting torque, of a hydraulically operated multiple-disc friction clutch and the like. The differential limiting control produces a large change in a vehicle maneuverability, depending upon its control characteristic. Further, in case of the differential limiting control having identical control logics and control constants, the maneuverability of a vehicle also varies according to the aged deterioration of tires or the difference of road conditions. Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. Toku-Kai-Hei 8-132914 discloses a technology of a vehicular torque distribution apparatus in which a driver directly establishes a differential limiting torque by manual operation based on the driver's judgment of road and traveling conditions to obtain a discretional torque distribution. However, in order to realize a vehicle maneuverability as intended by a driver, the differential limiting torque must be properly changed according to road conditions or miscellaneous traveling conditions. Accordingly, it is difficult to coincide the manually inputted differential limiting torque with a proper torque in order to obtain an optimum maneuverability. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is an object of the present invention to provide a vehicular power distribution control apparatus capable of realizing an optimum maneuverability suitable for traveling conditions and road conditions while reflecting the intention of a driver. To attain the object, a power distribution control apparatus for distributing an input torque transmitted through an input shaft into a first output torque and a second output torque through a first output shaft and a second output shaft, respectively by means of a differential gear unit and for controlling a distribution ratio of the first output torque to the second output torque by controlling an engagement force of a clutch mechanism provided between the first output shaft and the second output shaft, comprises target differential rotation speed establishing means for selectively establishing a target differential rotation speed between the first and second output shafts, actual differential rotation speed detecting means for detecting an actual differential rotation speed between the first and second output shafts and differential limiting torque establishing means for selectively establishing a differential 8 limiting torque of the clutch at least based on the target differential rotation speed, the actual differential rotation speed and a deviation between the target differential rotation speed and the actual differential rotation speed. Further, more specifically, the differential limiting torque establishing means includes first differential limiting torque calculating means for calculating a first differential limiting torque at least based on a time-versus integration of the deviation, second differential limiting torque calculating means for calculating a second differential limiting torque based on the deviation and a proportional term gain selectively established, and a third differential limiting torque establishing means for selectively establishing an initial torque at least based on a throttle opening angle and establishes the differential limiting torque by summing up the first differential limiting torque, the second differential limiting torque and the initial torque.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Referring now to FIG. 1, reference numeral 1 denotes an engine mounted on a front part of a vehicle. Driving force of the engine 1 is transmitted to a center differential 3 through an automatic transmission 2 (including a torque converter) and a transmission output shaft 2a. Further, the driving force of the engine 1 inputs from the center differential 3 to a rear final reduction gear unit 7 through a rear drive shaft 4, a propeller shaft 5 and a drive pinion 6 and on the other hand the driving force inputs from the center differential 3 to a front final reduction gear unit 11 through a transfer drive gear 8, a transfer driven gear 9 and a front drive shaft 10. The automatic transmission 2 is accommodated integrally with the center differential 3 and the front final reduction gear unit 11 in a casing 12. The driving force inputted to the rear final reduction gear unit 7 is transmitted to a rear left wheel 14RL and a rear right wheel 14RR through a rear left drive shaft 13RL and a rear right drive shaft 13RR, respectively. Further, the driving force inputted to the front final reduction gear unit 11 is transmitted to a front left wheel 14FL and a front right wheel 14FR through a front left axle shaft 13FL and a front right axle shaft 13FR, respectively. The center differential 3 incorporates a first sun gear 15 having a large diameter and mounted on the transmission output shaft 2a. The first sun gear 15 meshes with a first pinion 16 having a small diameter, thus a first gear train being constituted. Further, a second sun gear 17 having a small diameter is mounted on the rear drive shaft 4 from which power is transmitted to rear wheels and meshes with a second pinion 18 having a large diameter, thus a second gear train being constituted. The first pinion 16 and the second pinion 18 are integrally formed with a pinion member 19 which is rotatably supported by a fixed shaft provided in a carrier 20. Further, the carrier 20 is connected at the front thereof with the transfer drive gear 8 from which power is transmitted to the front wheels. Further, the carrier 20 is rotatably fitted at the front section thereof over the output shaft 2a of the transmission 2 and is rotatably fitted at the rear section thereof over the rear drive shaft 4. Further, the first and second sun gears 15, 17 are accommodated in the central space of the carrier 20. In FIG. 1, only one pinion member 19 is illustrated, however in an actual construction, plural pinion members 19 are provided around the sun gears 15, 17. Thus, the center differential 3 is formed as a compound planetary gear unit having an input member in the transmission shaft 2a, an output member in the rear drive shaft 4 and the other output member in the carrier 20. The center differential 3 of a compound planetary type is provided with a differential function by properly establishing the number of teeth of the first and second sun gears 15, 17 and the first and second pinions 16, 18. Further, the center differential 3 is furnished with a desired base torque distribution, for example an unequal torque distribution biased on rear wheels, by appropriately establishing working pitch circles of the first and second sun gears 15, 17 and the first and second pinions 16, 18. Further, the center differential 3 is designed in such a manner that the first and second sun gears 15, 17 and the first and second pinions 16, 18 have helical teeth, respectively, leaving thrust loads. As a result, the thrust loads produce a friction torque at an end of the respective pinion members 19. Further, a resultant force of separation force and tangential force generated by meshing of the gears exerts on the fixed shaft provided in the carrier 20, producing another friction torque between the respective pinion members 19 and the respective fixed shafts. Since these friction torques are obtained as a differential limiting torque which is proportional to the input torque, a differential limiting function is given to the center differential 3 itself. Further, there is provided a center differential clutch (transfer clutch) 21 of a hydraulic multiple disc clutch type for varying the front-to-rear torque distribution between two output members, the carrier 20 and the rear drive shaft 4, of the center differential 3. When the engagement force of this transfer clutch 21 is adjusted, the front-to-rear torque distribution ratio can be varied from 50:50 in a fully engaged condition to an inherent front-to-rear torque distribution ratio, for example 35:65, of the center differential 3 in a released condition. The transfer clutch 21 is connected with a center differential clutch drive section 41 constituted by a hydraulic circuit including a plurality of solenoid valves. Hydraulic pressure generated in the center differential clutch driving section 41 actuates a piston (not shown) to engage or release the transfer clutch 21. Further, control signals for driving the center differential clutch drive section 41, that is, input signals to the respective solenoid valves, are outputted from a differential limiting control section 40. The rear final reduction gear unit 7 comprises a differential mechanism 22 using bevel gears and a rear differential clutch 23 using a multiple disc clutch. The rear differential clutch 23 is provided between a differential case 25 to which a ring gear 24 is fixed and a rear right axle shaft 13RR. The ring gear 24 meshes with the drive pinion 6 to drive the differential mechanism 22. The front final reduction gear unit 11 is constituted by a differential mechanism 26 of bevel gear type and a front disc clutch 27 using multiple discs in the same manner as the rear final reduction gear unit 7. The front disc clutch 27 is provided between a differential case 29 to which a ring gear 28 is fixed and a front right axle shaft 13FR. The ring gear 28 meshes with a drive pinion of the front drive shaft 10 to drive the differential mechanism 26. The differential limiting control section 40 inputs parameters necessary for control from respective sensors and switches. Wheel speeds of the wheels, 14FL, 14FR, 14RL and 14RR are detected by wheel speed sensors 31FL, 31FR, 31RL and 31RR respectively and are inputted to the differential limiting control section 40. Further, a steering wheel angle detected by a steering wheel angle sensor 32 and a throttle opening angle detected by a throttle opening angle sensor 33 are inputted to the differential limiting control section 40, respectively. Further, a variable dial 34 is disposed in an accessible position to a driver to establish a differential limiting torque within a range between a \"differential open\" position and a \"differential lock\" position. When the driver adjusts the variable dial 34 to a desired position, a signal corresponding to that position inputs to the differential limiting control section 40. The differential limiting control section 40 is constituted by a micro-computer and its interface circuits. As shown in FIG. 2, a vehicle speed calculating section 40a, a front-rear actual differential rotation speed calculating section 40b, a front-rear target differential rotation speed calculating section 40c, a front-rear differential rotation speed deviation calculating section 40d, a front-rear control start differential rotation speed establishing section 40e, a front-rear control start condition judging section 40f, a first front-rear differential limiting torque calculating section 40g, a second front-rear differential limiting torque calculating section 40h, a third front-rear differential limiting torque calculating section 40i and a front-rear differential limiting torque calculating section 40j. The vehicle speed calculating section 40a inputs wheel speeds .omega.fl, .omega.fr, .omega.rl, .omega.rr of the wheels 14FL, 14FR, 14RL, 14RR from the wheel speed sensors 31FL, 31FR, 31RL, 31RR, respectively. A vehicle speed V is calculated by averaging these wheel speeds and is outputted to the front-rear control start differential rotation speed calculating section 40e. The front-rear actual differential rotation speed calculating section 40b inputs the wheel speeds .omega.fl, .omega.fr, .omega.rl, .omega.rr of the wheels 14FL, 14FR, 14RL, 14RR from the wheel speed sensors 31FL, 31FR, 31RL, 31RR, respectively and calculates an actual differential rotation speed .DELTA..omega.ctr between front and rear drive shafts according to the following formula (1). The front-rear actual differential rotation speed calculating section 40b acts as actual differential rotation speed detecting means in the differential limiting control of the center differential. The actual differential rotation speed .DELTA..omega.ctr between front and rear drive shafts calculated in the front-rear actual differential rotation speed calculating section 40b is outputted to the front-rear differential rotation speed deviation calculating section 40d and the front-rear control start condition judging section 40f, respectively. The front-rear target differential rotation speed establishing section 40c inputs a signal indicative of a dial position of the variable dial 34 and establishes a front-rear target differential rotation speed .DELTA..omega.ctrt by referring to a table showing the relationship between dial position and front-rear target differential rotation speed .DELTA..omega.ctrt. FIG. 3 is an example of the table which is obtained from prior experiments and calculations. In case where a driver prefers a crispy driving and enjoys a good turning ability, the variable dial 34 is set to a \"differential open\" position so as to establish the front-rear target differential rotation speed .DELTA..omega.ctrt at a large value. On the other hand, in case where the driver prefers a steady and safe driving, the variable dial 34 is set to a \"differential lock\" position so as to establish the front-rear target differential rotation speed .DELTA..omega.ctrt at a small value. The front-rear target differential rotation speed .DELTA..omega.ctrt may be corrected by the vehicle speed V in such a manner that as the vehicle speed V becomes large, the front-rear target differential rotation speed .DELTA..omega.ctrt becomes smaller. The front-rear target differential rotation speed .DELTA..omega.ctrt established at the front-rear target differential rotation speed establishing section 40c is outputted to the front-rear differential rotation speed deviation calculating section 40d. The front-rear target differential rotation speed establishing section 40c serves as target differential rotation speed establishing means in the differential limiting control of the center differential. The front-rear differential rotation speed deviation calculating section 40d calculates a deviation (front-rear differential rotation speed deviation) .epsilon.ctr based on the actual differential rotation speed .DELTA..omega.ctr between the front and rear drive shafts inputted from the front-rear actual differential rotation speed calculating section 40b and the target differential rotation speed .DELTA..omega.ctrt inputted from the front-rear target differential rotation speed establishing section 40c according to the following formula (2) and is outputted to the first front-rear differential limiting torque calculating section 40g and the second front-rear differential limiting torque calculating section 40h, respectively. The front-rear control start differential rotation speed establishing section 40e inputs a vehicle speed V from the vehicle speed calculating section 40a and establishes a front-rear control start differential rotation speed .DELTA..omega.ctrs by reference to a table indicating the relationship between front-rear control start differential rotation speed .DELTA..omega.ctrs. That relationship is obtained from prior experiments and calculations. This front-rear control start differential rotation speed .DELTA..omega.ctrs is established to a smaller value than the front-rear target differential rotation speed .DELTA..omega.ctrt, for example, a lower limit value of the actual differential rotation speed .DELTA..omega.ctr between front and rear drive shafts. The front-rear control start differential rotation speed .DELTA..omega.ctrs is established by referring to a table as shown in FIG. 4. The table is prepared based on vehicle specifications in consideration of miscellaneous errors encountered in actual traveling. Further, according to the embodiment of the present invention, the front-rear control start differential rotation speed establishing section 40e inputs a signal indicative of a steering wheel angle from the steering wheel angle sensor 32. The front-rear control start differential rotation speed .DELTA..omega.ctrs established in accordance with the vehicle speed V is corrected by the steering angle such that as the steering angle becomes large, the front-rear control start differential rotation speed .DELTA..omega.ctrs becomes larger as shown in FIG. 5. Thus established front-rear control start differential rotation speed .DELTA..omega.ctrs is outputted to the front-rear control start condition judging section 40f. The front-rear control start condition judging section 40f inputs the front-rear actual differential rotation speed .DELTA..omega.ctr and the front-rear control start differential rotation speed .DELTA..omega.ctrs from the front-rear differential rotation speed calculating section 40b and the front-rear control start differential rotation speed establishing section 40e, respectively and compares the front-rear actual differential rotation speed .DELTA..omega.ct with the front-rear control start differential rotation speed .DELTA..omega.ctrs to judge whether or not the start condition of differential control is satisfied. In case where the front-rear actual differential rotation speed .DELTA..omega.ctr is larger than the front-rear control start differential rotation speed .DELTA..omega.ctrs, the front-rear control start condition judging section 40f judges that the start condition of differential control has been satisfied and outputs the judgment to the first front-rear differential limiting torque calculating section 40g. The first front-rear differential limiting torque calculating section 40g inputs a front-rear differential rotation speed deviation .epsilon.ctr and the result of the judgment of the control start from the front-rear differential rotation speed deviation calculating section 40d and the front-rear control start condition judging section 40f, respectively and calculates a first front-rear differential limiting torque Tsmcctr according to the following formulas (3) and (4): where integration is performed from 0 to t; kictr is integral term gain. where kwctr is differential term gain; jwctr is inertia term; Tsgctr is changeover gain; and .delta.ctr is constant to give continuity to differential limiting force for the purpose of preventing chattering. In case of X>0, the first front-rear differential limiting torque Tsmcctr is let be equal to X and in case of X.ltoreq.0, the first front-rear differential limiting torque Tsmcctr is let be 0. Further, in case where the control start condition is not satisfied (.DELTA..omega.ctr.ltoreq..DELTA..omega.ctrs), letting Tsmcctr=0, .intg.(.epsilon.ctr)dt is reset to 0. That is, in case where the front-rear actual differential rotation speed .DELTA..omega.ctr is smaller than the front-rear control start differential rotation speed .DELTA..omega.ctrs, which is a lower limit of the front-rear actual differential rotation speed .DELTA..omega.ctr, the first front-rear differential limiting torque Tsmcctr is let be 0 in order to avoid a condition that the transfer clutch 21 is locked up due to a static friction coefficient. Further, the integration term is prevented from becoming an excessively low value by resetting the integration term .intg.(.epsilon.ctr)dt to 0. if the integration term is too low, when the transfer clutch 21 starts to slip again, the control lag increases and as a result \"stick and slip\" phenomenon is promoted. Thus calculated first front-rear differential limiting torque Tsmcctr is outputted to the front-rear differential limiting torque calculating section 40j. The second front-rear differential limiting torque calculating section 40h inputs a front-rear differential rotation speed deviation .epsilon.ctr and a signal indicative of a dial position from the front-rear differential rotation speed deviation calculating section 40d and the variable dial 34, respectively and calculates a second front-rear differential limiting torque Tpcctr according to the following formula (5). Where kpctr is proportional term gain which is established by referring to a table prepared beforehand according to the dial position of the variable dial 34. The table is shown in FIG. 6. In which, the proportional term gain kpctr is established to a small value so as to decrease the second front-rear differential limiting torque Tpcctr in case where the variable dial 34 is set on a \"differential open\" side (crispy driving side based on a good turning ability). On the other hand, in case where the variable dial 34 is set on a \"differential lock\" side (steady and safe driving side), the proportional term gain kpctr is established to a large value so as to increase the second front-rear differential limiting torque Tpcctr. Thus calculated second front-rear differential limiting torque Tpcctr is outputted to the front-rear differential limiting torque calculating section 40j. The third front-rear differential limiting torque calculating section 40i inputs a throttle opening angle and a signal corresponding to a dial position from the throttle opening angle sensor 33 and the variable dial 34, respectively and establishes a third front-rear differential limiting torque Ti as an initial torque based on these parameters by referring to a table determined by experiments and calculations beforehand. According to the table, as shown in FIG. 7, when the dial is set on a \"differential open\" side (crispy driving side), the third front-rear differential limiting torque or the initial torque Ti is established to a small value and when the dial is set on a \"differential lock\" side (steady and safe driving side), the initial torque Ti is established to a large value. Further, as the throttle opening angle becomes large, the initial torque Ti is established to a larger value according to a table shown in FIG. 8. Thus obtained initial torque Ti is added to the first and second front-rear differential limiting torques as will be described hereinafter. The addition of the initial torque Ti enables to enhance the stability in traveling on a road surface with low friction coefficient. The third front-rear differential limiting torque or initial torque Ti is outputted to the front-rear differential limiting torque calculating section 40j. The front-rear differential limiting torque calculating section 40j inputs the first front-rear differential limiting torque Tsmcctr, the second front-rear differential limiting torque Tpcctr and the initial torque Ti from the first front-rear differential limiting torque calculating section 40g, the second front-rear differential limiting torque calculating section 40h and the third front-rear differential limiting torque calculating section 40i, respectively and calculates a final front-rear differential limiting torque Tlsdctr according to the following formula (6). Then, the front-rear differential limiting torque calculating section 40j outputs a signal indicative of hydraulic pressure for producing this final front-rear differential limiting torque Tlsdctr to the center differential clutch drive section 41. According to the embodiment, differential limiting toque calculating means are constituted by the front-rear differential rotation speed deviation calculating section 40d, the first front-rear differential limiting torque calculating section 40g, the second front-rear differential limiting torque calculating section 40h, the third front-rear differential limiting torque calculating section 40i and the front-rear differential limiting torque calculating section 40j. Now, a flow of the processes in the differential limiting control section 40 will be described by reference to a flowchart shown in FIG. 9. First, at a step (hereinafter abbreviated as \"S\") 101, wheel speeds .omega.fl, .omega.fr, .omega.rl, .omega.rr of the respective wheels, 14FL, 14FR, 14RL, 14RR, a steering wheel angle, a throttle opening angle, a dial position indicated by a driver and the like, are read. Then, the program goes to S102 where a vehicle speed is calculated in the vehicle speed calculating section 40a and goes to S103 where a front-rear target differential rotation speed .DELTA..omega.ctrt is established in the front-rear target differential rotation speed establishing section 40c by referring to a map parameterizing dial position and front-rear target differential rotation speed .DELTA..omega.ctrt. Next, the program goes to S104 where a front-rear control start differential rotation speed .DELTA..omega.ctrs is established by referring to a map parameterizing vehicle speed and front-rear control start differential rotation speed .DELTA..omega.ctrt after being corrected by the steering wheel angle. The program goes to S105 where an actual differential rotation speed .DELTA..omega.ctr between front and rear drive shafts is calculated in the front-rear actual differential rotation speed calculating section 40b according to the formula (1). After that, the program goes to S106 where the front-rear actual differential rotation speed .DELTA..omega.ctr is compared with the front-rear control start differential rotation speed .DELTA..omega.ctrs in the front-rear control start condition judging section 40f and when it is judged that the control start condition is satisfied, goes to S107. At S107, a front-rear a front-rear differential rotation speed deviation .epsilon.ctr is calculated in the front-rear differential rotation speed deviation calculating section 40d according to the formula (2) and the program goes to S108. At S108, the front-rear differential rotation speed deviation .epsilon.ctr is integrated from 0 to t in the first front-rear differential limiting torque calculating section 40g and the program goes to S109 where a first front-rear differential limiting torque Tsmcctr is calculated in the same differential limiting torque calculating section 40g. The first front-rear differential limiting torque Tsmcctr depends upon X calculated in the formula (4). In case of X>0, the first front-rear differential limiting torque Tsmcctr is let be equal to X and in case of X.ltoreq.0, the first front-rear differential limiting torque Tsmcctr is let be 0. Then the program goes to S110. On the other hand, in case where at S106 the front-rear differential rotation speed .DELTA..omega.ctr is smaller than the front-rear control start differential rotation speed .DELTA..omega.cts, it is judged that the control start condition is not satisfied and the program goes to S115. At S115, the front-rear differential limiting torque Tsmcctr is established to 0, Then the program goes to S116 where the integral of the .epsilon.ctr is reset to 0 and goes to S110. When the program goes from S109 or S116 to S110, a proportional term gain kpctr is established by reference to the table of the proportional term gain in the second front-rear differential limiting torque calculating section 40h and the program goes to S111 where a second front-rear differential limiting torque Tpcctr, namely, a proportional term is calculated according to the formula (5). Next, the program goes to S112 where a third front-rear differential limiting torque, namely, an initial torque Ti is calculated based on the throttle opening angle and the dial position in the front-rear differential limiting torque calculating section 40i. Then, the program goes to S113 where a final front-rear differential limiting torque Tlsdctr is calculated by summing up the first front-rear differential limiting torque Tsmcctr, the second front-rear differential limiting torque Tpcctr and the initial torque Ti according to the formula (6) in the front-rear differential limiting torque calculating section 40j and then goes to S114 where a signal indicative of hydraulic pressure for producing this final front-rear differential limiting torque Tlsdctr is outputted to the center differential clutch drive section 41, leaving the routine. Thus, according to the embodiment, since a differential limiting torque inputted by manual operation is corrected by traveling conditions and road surface conditions, an optimum maneuverability reflecting a driver's intention can be obtained. In this embodiment, the power distribution control between front and rear wheels, that is, the control of the transfer clutch 21 provided between front and rear drive shafts is described, however the principle of the present invention can be applied to the control of the rear differential clutch 23 or the front differential clutch 27.

In the transmission, a counter shaft is incorporated below and in parallel with the main shaft. There are provided a main transmission and a sub transmission between the main shaft and the counter shaft. The driving force of the engine is divided into a front driving force and a rear driving force by a center differential and the front driving force is transmitted from the counter shaft to front wheels through a front drive shaft incorporated below and in parallel with the counter shaft and a front differential. The rear driving force is transmitted to rear wheels through a rear drive shaft and a rear differential.

Description BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a transmission for a vehicle and more particularly to an automobile transmission which can be assembled using components shared among a plurality of transmission types. 2. Discussion of Prior Arts A transmission for transmitting engine power to driving wheel and for changing engine rotational speeds, is connected with a crankshaft of an engine through a clutch and has a main shaft and a counter shaft provided in parallel with the main shaft. The main shaft is provided with a plurality of driving gears and the counter shaft is provided with a plurality of driven gears meshing with the driving gears. When a driver operates a shift lever, a power transmission path obtained by a gear set of a driving gear and driven gear is established. There is no difference in the basic construction between a transmission for front wheel drive vehicle and one for four wheel drive vehicle. In case where the engine is mounted in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle, since the transmission is connected with the rear end of the engine, a power unit of the combination of the engine and transmission is required to reduce its own length so as to secure a space utility of the passenger compartment of the vehicle. To reduce the length of such a power unit, Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. Toku-Kai-Hei 1-156134 discloses a drive train for automobile in which a longitudinally mounted engine is slanted in the widthwise direction and a final reduction gear unit or a differential separated from the transmission is disposed on the slanted side of the engine. In this case, the axle shaft penetrates the side wall of an oil pan and crankcase of the engine. Further, Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. Toku-Kai-Hei 7-167257 discloses a technique in which the final reduction gear unit is integrated with the transmission. This type of drive train is characterized in a simple layout and a good mountability. On the other hand, a multiple speed ratio transmission is required in market from the view point of vehicle performance. Particularly, in case of four wheel drive vehicles, a multiple speed ratio transmission or a dual range transmission is strongly requested. For example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. Toku-Kai-Shou 55-4293 proposes a dual range type transmission having a sub-transmission between the crankshaft and the main shaft so as to change over the rotation speed of the crankshaft into two stages, Low and High, with respect to the main shaft. In order to raise a productivity of transmissions, it is required that components of the transmission are shared between a plurality of models or body types. For example, it is required that components common to both front wheel drive vehicles and four wheel drive vehicles are used on assembling transmissions. In response to these requirements, as disclosed in Toku-Kai-Hei 1-156134, in case where the final reduction gear unit is disposed on the side of the engine, the axle shaft penetrates the side walls of the oil pan and the crankcase. Accordingly, an attempt to apply a dual transmission mechanism to this type transmission elongates the longitudinal size the transmission and as a result the layout of the drive train becomes more complicated. Further, as shown in Toku-Kai-Hei 7-167257, in case where the final reduction gear unit is integrated with the transmission, the layout of the drive train is simplified, however since generally a front drive shaft is fitted to the hollow counter shaft, the length of the transmission increases. It is disadvantageous in length that a multiple speed ratio gearing mechanism or a dual range mechanism is further incorporated into the transmission. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is an object of the present invention to provide a transmission whose drive train layout is simple, even in case where a multiple speed ratio transmission mechanism or a dual range mechanism is incorporated into the transmission. It is another object of the present invention to provide a compact transmission easy to be mounted on a vehicle. It is further object of the present invention to share components among a plurality of transmission types in order to reduce manufacturing cost of the transmission. To achieve these objects, the present invention comprises a main shaft connected with a crankshaft of an engine through a clutch and having a plurality of first drive gears, a counter shaft provided below and in parallel with the main shaft and having first driven gears meshing with the first drive gears and having a second drive gear, a drive shaft provided below and in parallel with the counter shaft and having a second driven gear meshing with the second drive gear, a front differential provided at a front end of the drive shaft, a transmission case for accommodating the main shaft, the counter shaft, the drive shaft and the front differential, a space formed in a front part of the transmission case, a center differential provided at a rear end of the counter shaft for distributing driving force into driving force for front wheels and driving force for rear wheels, a sub transmission accommodated in the space for transmitting driving force of the engine to the main shaft while reducing the rotation speed of the engine.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Referring to FIG. 1, numeral 4 denotes a transmission case including a front transmission case 1, an intermediate transmission case 2 and a rear transmission case 3. The transmission case 4 is connected at the front end thereof with an engine 5 which is longitudinally mounted in an engine room and is connected at the rear end thereof with an extension case 6. An input shaft 7 is rotatably supported by a bearing 1b provided in a front wall 1a of the front transmission case 1. The input shaft 7 is connected with a flywheel 9 which is mounted on a crankshaft 8 of the engine 5 through a clutch 10. Further, the input shaft 7 is spline-fitted to a clutch hub 10a. A main shaft 11 extends coaxially with the input shaft 7 in the longitudinal direction of a vehicle ant is rotatably mounted in the transmission case 4. The main shaft 11 is rotatably fitted at a front end thereof to a rear end of the input shaft 7 and is supported by the bearing 1b through the input shaft 7. Further, the main shaft 11 is supported at a rear end thereof by a bearing 3a provided in the rear transmission case 3. Furthermore, the main shaft 11 is supported at an intermediate portion thereof by a bearing 2a. Further, a counter shaft 12 is rotatably mounted in the transmission case 4 in parallel with and below the main shaft 11. The counter shaft 12 is supported at a front end thereof by a bearing 1c provided in the front transmission case 1 and is supported at a rear end thereof by a bearing 3b provided in the rear transmission case 3. A main transmission section 13 having five forward speeds is formed by gear sets provided between the main shaft 11 and the counter shaft 12 in the intermediate transmission case 2 and the rear transmission case 3. Further, a sub transmission 14 having two ranges of speed, high and low, is formed by gear sets provided between the input shaft 7, the main shaft 11 and the counter shaft 12 in the front transmission case 1. The sub transmission 14 has an input gear 15 mounted on the input shaft 7, a driven gear 16 rotatably mounted on the main shaft 11 and a counter sleeve 19 rotatably mounted on the counter shaft 12 through a needle bearing. The counter sleeve 19 includes a counter gear 17 constantly meshing with the input shaft 15 and a low range gear 18 constantly meshing with the driven gear 16. There is provided a range changeover section 20 composed of a synchromesh having a sleeve 20a (see FIG. 2) and the like between the input gear 15 and the driven gear 16. When the range switching section 20 operates to engage the sleeve 20a with a spline of the input shaft 7, the input shaft 7 is connected with the main shaft 11. On the other hand, when the sleeve 20a is engaged with a spline of the driven gear 16, the rotation of the input shaft 7 is transmitted to the main shaft 11 through counter sleeve 19, while the rotation speed is reduced by a gear ratio, thereby a low range is obtained. Thus constituted sub transmission 14 can utilize the counter shaft 12 of the main transmission 13 as a counter shaft for the sub transmission 14 without providing a counter shaft dedicated to the sub transmission. Accordingly, a longitudinal size of the overall transmission can be saved. Further, since a counter shaft dedicated to the sub transmission can be abolished, the number of parts can be reduced. In the main transmission section 13, the main shaft 11 is provided with a first (1.sup.st) speed gear 21, a second (2.sup.nd) speed gear 22 which rotate integrally therewith and a third (3.sup.rd) speed gear 23 and a fourth speed gear (4.sup.th) which rotate freely thereabout. Further, the main shaft 11 is provided with a reverse gear 26 which rotates integrally therewith. Further, in the front transmission case 1, a fifth (5.sup.th) speed gear 25 is rotatably mounted on the main shaft 11 adjacent to the sub transmission section 14. A driven gear 21a constantly meshing with the first speed gear 21 and a driven gear 22a constantly meshing with the second speed gear 22 are rotatably mounted on the counter shaft 12. Further, a driven gear 23a constantly meshing with the third speed gear 23, a driven gear 24a constantly meshing with the fourth speed gear 24 and a driven gear 25a constantly meshing with the fifth speed gear 25 are securedly mounted on the counter shaft 12 to rotate integrally with the shaft 12. The counter shaft 12 is provided with a synchromesh 27 having a sleeve 27a and the like between the driven gears 21a and 22a. When the sleeve 27a is engaged with a spline of the driven gear 21a, the rotation of the main shaft 11 is transmitted to the counter shaft 12 through the first speed gear 21. When the sleeve 27a is engaged with a spline of the driven gear 22a, the rotation of the main shaft 11 is transmitted to the counter shaft 12 through the first speed gear 22. The sleeve 27a of the synchromesh 27 meshes with a reverse gear 26 through a reverse idle gear (not shown). The main shaft 11 is provided with a synchromesh 28 having a sleeve 28a and the like between the third speed gear 23 and the fourth speed gear 24. When the sleeve 28a is engaged with a spline of the third speed gear 23, the rotation of the main shaft 11 is transmitted to the counter shaft 12 through the third speed gear 23. When the sleeve 28a is engaged with a spline of the fourth speed gear 24, the rotation of the main shaft 11 is transmitted to the counter shaft 12 through the fourth speed gear 24. The main shaft 12 is provided with a synchromesh 29 having a sleeve 29a and the like adjacent to the fifth speed gear 25. When the sleeve 29a is engaged with a spline of the fifth speed gear 25, the rotation of the main shaft 11 is transmitted to the counter shaft 12. Thus, since the main transmission 13 has shift stages of five forward speeds and the sub transmission 14 has two speed ranges, high and low, this transmission is a dual range transaxle type transmission having shift stages of ten forward speeds in total. Referring to FIG. 3, there is provided a spline hole at the rear end of the counter shaft 12. The spline hole is engaged with an input shaft 31 of a center differential 30. Accordingly, the output of the main and sub transmissions 13, 14 is inputted to the center differential 30 through the counter shaft 12. The input shaft 31 is supported by bearings 3c and 6a. The center differential 30 has a pinion shaft 33 fixedly penetrating the input shaft 31 in the radial direction thereof and secured to a differential case 32. Differential pinions 34, 35 are rotatably mounted on the pinion shaft 33 and mesh with differential side gears 36, 37, respectively. There is provided a viscous coupling 38 between the side gear 36 and the differential case 32. The differential side gear 36 is spline-fitted over a rear drive gear 39 which is rotatably mounted on the input shaft 31 through a needle bearing. The rear drive gear 39 meshes with a driven gear 42 of a rear wheel drive shaft or a rear drive shaft 41 rotatably supported by the extension case 6 through bearings 6b, 6c. The other differential side gear 37 is spline-fitted over a front drive gear 43 which is rotatably mounted on the counter shaft 12 through a needle bearing. The front drive gear 43 meshes with a driven gear 45 of a front wheel drive shaft or a front drive shaft 44 rotatably supported by bearings 1d, 3d. As shown in FIG. 2, a front differential 46 is incorporated in the front transmission case 1. The front differential 46 includes a hypoid gear 46 which meshes with a hypoid pinion 48 secured to the front end of the front drive shaft 44. Further, as shown in FIG. 1, the rear drive shaft 41 is connected with a rear differential 49 through a propeller shaft. Thus, the driving torque distributed by the center differential 30 is transmitted to front and rear wheels through the front and rear differentials 46, 49, respectively. The front transmission case 1 has a space 50a partitioned by the intermediate transmission case 2 in the upper part thererof. This space 50a provides a sub transmission chamber accommodating the sub transmission 14 and the fifth speed gear 25 for high range. In the lower part of the front transmission case 1, a differential chamber 50b for accommodating the front differential 46 is formed. As shown in FIG. 3, the partition wall between the rear end of the rear transmission case 3 and the bearing 6c is provided with an oil pump 51, whose drive shaft is connected with the rear end of the main shaft 11. Thus, the oil pump 51 is driven by the main shaft 11. The drive shaft of the oil pump 51 has a hollow hole through which oil is discharged. The discharged oil is supplied to hollow holes provided in the center of axis of the main shaft 11 and the counter shaft 12, that is, lubrication oil passages, to lubricate components of the transmission. Referring to FIG. 4, the counter shaft 12 is positioned below the main shaft 11 and its center of axis is offset by S1 in an one widthwise direction of the vehicle. Further, the front drive shaft 44 is offset by S2 in the other widthwise direction of the vehicle. This arrangement of the shafts 11, 12 and 44 is effective for reducing the vertical size of the transmission case 4. Since in thus constructed transmission the front drive shaft 44 is arranged below the counter shaft 12 differently from a type of transmission in which the front drive shaft 44 is incorporated into the counter shaft 12, the sub transmission 14 can be incorporated between the main shaft 11 and the counter shaft 12 and at the same time the front differential 46 can be incorporated into the front transmission case 1 without enlarging the longitudinal size of the transmission. Further, since the longitudinal size of the transmission is reduced, an interior space of the passenger compartment can be secured and a power unit having a good mountability onto the vehicle is obtained. A front wall 1a of the front transmission case 1 facing the clutch 10 is provided with bearings 1b, 1c. As shown in FIG. 4, since each of the transmission case 1, the intermediate transmission case 2 and the rear transmission case 3 has a cylinder-like configuration enclosing the main shaft 11 and the like peripherally, the strength of the transmission case 4 can be increased, compared to the transmission case having a longitudinal mating surface. Further, since these transmission cases 1, 2 and 3 have a drum-like configuration respectively, the transmission can be assembled in an upright position and as a result the work efficiency is enhanced. Next, describing a second embodiment by reference to FIGS. 5 and 6, this manual transmission is applied to a four wheel drive vehicle similarly to the first embodiment but it is not provided with a sub transmission 14. In these drawings, the components identical both to the first: and second embodiments are denoted by identical reference numbers. Accordingly, the transmission does not include an input gear 15, a driven gear 16, a counter sleeve 19 and a range changeover section 20. Further, since the transmission has no sub transmission, the input shaft 7 is replaced with a main shaft 11a. As shown in FIG. 6, a front end of the main shaft 11a is spline-fitted to a clutch hub 10a. On the other hand, since this transmission has the same structure as the transmission of FIG. 3 except the components for the sub transmission including the configuration of the front transmission 1, transmission components can be shared with other types of transmission. Thus, transmissions with and without sub transmission can be assembled using common parts. FIG. 7 is a skeleton diagram of an automobile manual transmission according to a third embodiment and FIG. 8 is a sectional view showing a rear part of the manual transmission. In these drawings, the components identical both to the second and third embodiments are denoted by identical reference numbers. This manual transmission is applied to a front drive vehicle and the construction of the transmission according to this embodiment has the same construction as a transmission portion excepting a four wheel drive mechanism of the transmission according to the second embodiment. In place of the extension case 6 of the second embodiment, a cover 52 is attached to the rear end of the transmission case 4. Further, another type of a front drive gear 43a is mounted on the counter shaft 12. Thus, a transmission dedicated to the front drive vehicle is obtained. In the transmission having no sub transmission as shown in FIGS. 5 and 7, by incorporating gears for 6.sup.th or more speed ratios into the space 50a, it is possible to realize a multiple speed ratio transmission with 6.sup.th or more speed ratios. In the preferred embodiments described before, a manual transmission is primarily exemplified, however other types of transmission, for example, an automatic transmission may be replaced with the manual transmission. That is, the present invention may be applied also to the automatic transmission. In summary, according to the present invention, components such as a transmission case, gear trains and the like can be shared among a transmission for four wheel drive vehicle with sub transmission, a transmission for four wheel drive vehicle without sub transmission and a transmission for front drive vehicle. Further, since the differential is incorporated in the transmission case and left and right axle shafts for transmitting driving force to left and right wheels respectively can have an identical length and therefore these axle shafts can be shared with each other. While the presently preferred embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described, it is to be understood that these disclosures are for the purpose of illustration and that various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims. * * * * *",

Description BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a manual transmission for a four-wheel drive vehicle capable of transmitting an engine power to both front and rear wheels of a vehicle. 2. Discussion of Related Arts Generally, a manual transmission comprises an input Shaft inputting engine power through a clutch, a plurality of drive gears mounted on the input shaft, an output shaft and a plurality of driven gears constantly meshing with the respective drive gears, forming a plurality of shift gear trains between the input and output shafts. Further, the manual transmission has clutches such as synchromesh mechanisms for changing over the engagement of the respective gear trains between a power transmission condition and a power shut-off condition and when a driver operates a shift lever, the clutches are actuated to change over either of the gear trains to a power transmission condition. The manual transmission for a four-wheel drive vehicle has a front drive shaft provided coaxially in a hollow output shaft and connected with a front final reduction gear apparatus or a front differential and a rear drive shaft connected with a rear final reduction gear apparatus or a rear differential through a propeller shaft. Further, the transmission has a power distribution apparatus or a transfer unit for distributing power between the front drive shaft and the rear drive shaft. The power distribution apparatus can change a power distribution ratio of front wheels to rear wheels of driving force, when drive wheels slip on a road surface with low friction coefficient or when there occurs a difference of rotation by more than a specified value between the front wheels and the rear wheels. In a conventional manual transmission for a four wheel drive vehicle in which the output shaft is disposed below the input shaft, the power distribution apparatus is disposed coaxially with the output shaft at the rear of the output shaft. In thus layouted transmission, a large thrust load is applied from an orthogonal gear of the front final reduction gear to bearings for supporting the output shaft through the front drive shaft. As a result, not only the bearings are needed to be up-sized, a large power loss generates in the bearings due to the large thrust load applied thereto. Further, the up-sizing of the bearings itself generates a larger rotational loss. Hence, this type of the manual transmission has a difficulty in enhancing an efficiency of power transmission. On the other hand, lubrication oil is accommodated in the transmission case in order to lubricate meshing surfaces of the gears and sliding surfaces of the shafts. When a vehicle travels, the lubrication oil is splashed by rotating gears and is supplied to required parts of the transmission. In case where the power distribution apparatus is coaxially disposed with the output shaft as described above, the power transmission apparatus is positioned at the lower part of the transmission. Hence, since the lubrication oil is agitated, while a large part of the power distribution apparatus is dipped in under the static oil level, a larger agitation resistance is exerted on the output shaft. To solve this problem, Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. Toku-Kai-Hei 10-166877 discloses a manual transmission for a four wheel drive vehicle in which an output shaft is coaxially disposed with a first input shaft connected to an engine and a second input shaft connected with the first input shaft through gears is arranged below the output shaft and a plurality of gear trains are provided between the output shaft and the second input shaft. The advantage of this transmission is that the power distribution apparatus can be disposed coaxially with the output shaft above the second input shaft and since the power distribution apparatus is located in a position higher than the oil level, the agitation resistance in the power distribution apparatus can be reduced. However, in this type of the transmission, since a front drive shaft is incorporated in a hollow second input shaft, there always exists a rotational difference between the second input shaft and the output shaft, except when the first input shaft is directly connected with the output shaft in a fourth gear position. That is, since the front drive shaft slides around the second input shaft with a working load of gear applied to both shafts, a loss of power transmission is generated on the sliding surface. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is an object of the present invention to provide a manual transmission in which there is no relative rotation between the hollow shaft and the front drive shaft inside of the hollow shaft, when a vehicle travels straightforwardly. It is another object of the present invention to enhance an efficiency of power transmission by reducing loads exerted from an orthogonal gear of a front final reduction gear on the bearings. It is further object of the present invention to reduce agitation resistance of lubrication oil in the power distribution apparatus. In order to achieve the objects, a manual transmission of a four-wheel drive vehicle having a front drive shaft for driving front wheels and a rear drive shaft for driving rear wheels, comprises an input shaft for inputting an engine power, a plurality of shift drive gears mounted on the input shaft, an output shaft hollowed inside and provided below the input shaft and incorporating the front drive shaft therein, a plurality of shift driven gears mounted on the output shaft and meshing with the shift driven gears, a plurality of shift gear trains formed by the shift drive gears and the shift driven gears meshing with the shift drive gears between the input and output shafts, a plurality of clutches for changing over the shift gear trains between a power transmitting condition and a power shut-off condition, an intermediate shaft disposed rotatably, coaxially with the input shaft, a first connection drive gear integrally mounted on the output shaft, a first connection driven gear integrally mounted on the intermediate shaft and meshing with the first connection drive gear, a second connection drive gear integrally mounted on the intermediate shaft, a second connection driven gear integrally mounted on the front drive shaft and meshing with the second connection drive gear, and a power distributing apparatus coaxially connected with the intermediate shaft and coaxially connected with the rear drive shaft for distributing a power transmitted from the intermediate shaft between the front drive shaft and the rear drive shaft. Further, the gears constituting the transmission are helical gears so as to generate an axial force to cancel the load from the orthogonal gear of the front final reduction gear unit.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT Referring now to FIG. 1, reference numeral 1 denotes an engine and reference numeral 2 denotes a clutch and reference numeral 3 denotes a manual transmission. The transmission 3 inputs power from the engine 1 through the clutch 2 and transmits the power to a front wheel 4a through a front wheel final reduction gear unit 5 and a rear wheel 4b through a propeller shaft 6 and a rear wheel final reduction gear unit 7 to a rear wheel 4b, respectively. The respective final reduction gear units 5, 7 have a differential gear unit, respectively. The manual transmission 3 is a five-forward-speed transmission mounted on a vehicle in a longitudinal direction of the vehicle. Referring to FIG. 2, an input shaft 8 to which an engine power is inputted through a crankshaft 1a of the engine 1 and the clutch 2, and a hollow output shaft 9 arranged in parallel with and below the input shaft 8, are rotatably incorporated in a transmission case 3a, respectively. A drive gear 11 of the first gear ratio and a drive gear 12 of the second gear ratio are integrally mounted on the input shaft 8 and a drive gear 13 of the third gear ratio and a drive gear 15 of the fifth gear ratio are rotatably mounted thereon. On the other hand, a driven gear 21 of the first gear ratio and a driven gear 22 of the second gear ratio are rotatably mounted on the output shaft 9 and a driven gear 23 of the third gear ratio and a driven gear 25 of the fifth gear ratio are integrally mounted thereon. The drive gears 11, 12 of the input shaft 8 constantly mesh with the driven gears 21, 22 of the output shaft 9, respectively. Further, the drive gears 13, 15 of the input shaft 8 constantly mesh with the driven gears 23, 25 of the output shaft 9, respectively. Thus, a first speed gear train is formed by the drive gear 11 and the driven gear 21 and a second speed gear train is formed by the drive gear 12 and the driven gear 22. Similarly, a third speed gear train is formed by the drive gear 13 and the driven gear 23 and a fifth speed gear train is formed by the drive gear 15 and the driven gear 25. Further, an intermediate shaft 10 is rotatably, coaxially coupled with the rear part of the input shaft 8. A driven gear 14 for the fourth gear ratio is integrally mounted on the intermediate shaft 10 and constantly meshes with a drive gear 24 integrally mounted on the output shaft 9. The drive gear 24 is for transmitting a shift output other than the fourth gear ratio. A first clutch 31 is provided on the output shaft 9 to change over the gear train into either of the first speed gear train, the second speed gear train and the neutral position in which power is transmitted nowhere. Further, a second clutch 32 is provided on the input shaft 8 to change over the gear train into either the fifth speed gear train or the neutral position and a third clutch 33 is provided on the input shaft 8 to change over the gear train into either of the third speed gear train, the fourth speed gear train and the neutral position. The respective clutches are constituted by a synchromesh mechanism. The first clutch 31 has a synchronizer hub 31a secured to the output shaft 9 and a synchronizer sleeve 31b axially slidable so as to engage with splines 21a, 22a provided in the gears 21, 22, respectively. The second and third clutches 32, 33 have synchronizer hubs 32a, 33a secured to the input clutch 8 and synchronizer sleeves 32b, 33b so as to engage with splines 15a, 13a, 14a provided in the respective gears 15, 13, 14, respectively. A desired gear position is obtained by actuating the respective clutches when a driver operates a shift lever. A reverse drive gear 17 is integrally mounted on the input shaft 8 and a reverse driven gear 27 is mounted on a synchronizer sleeve 31b. Further, an idler gear (not shown) is axially slidably mounted on an idler shaft (not shown) and when the idler gear engages with the drive gear 17 and the driven gear 27, the rotation of the input shaft 8 is reversely transmitted to the output shaft 9. The axial movement of the idler gear is performed by an operation mechanism (not shown). When gear positions other than the fourth gear ratio, that is, the first gear ratio, the second gear ratio, the third gear ratio and the fifth gear ratio, are established, the engine power inputted to the input shaft 8 is transmitted to the output shaft 9 and further transmitted to the intermediate shaft 10 through the connection gear train 24, 14. When the fourth gear ratio is selected, the input shaft 8 is directly connected with the intermediate shaft 10 by the clutch 33 and the engine power is transmitted directly from the input shaft 8 to the intermediate shaft 10. A front drive shaft 34 is rotatably, coaxially incorporated in the hollow output shaft 9 and has an orthogonal gear 35 at the front end thereof. The orthogonal gear 35 meshes with a reduction gear 36 to transmit power to a front wheel 4a. The intermediate shaft 10 is connected with a power distribution apparatus (hereinafter, referred to as transfer unit) 40 constituted by a center differential unit comprising a planetary gear train 41 and a multiple disc clutch 42. The transfer unit 40 has a drive gear 38 meshing with a driven gear 37 integrally formed with a rear end of the front drive shaft 34. That is, a front drive gear train is formed by these gears 37, 38. Further, the transfer unit 40 has a rear drive section 39 connected to the propeller shaft 6. When a rotational difference occurs between front and rear wheels, the rotational difference is absorbed by a differential rotation of the planetary gear train. Thus, since the transfer unit 40 is mounted on the intermediate shaft 10 arranged above the output shaft 9, the oil level of lubrication oil accommodated in a transmission case 3a is in a lower position than the transfer unit 40, the miscellaneous rotating components in the transfer unit 40 never agitates the lubrication oil and as a result the agitation resistance applied to the transfer unit 40 can be reduced, whereby the fuel economy is enhanced. The gear ratio of the connection gear train formed by the driven gear 14 and the drive gear 24 and that of the front drive gear train formed by the driven gear 38 and the driven gear 37 are equal to 1.0 respectively. Accordingly, the rotation speed of the intermediate shaft 10 is equal to that of the output shaft 9 over all gear positions. When the vehicle travels straightforwardly, since there is no differential rotation in the transfer unit 40, the output shaft 9 rotates integrally with the front drive shaft 34 incorporated in the output shaft 9 and there is no sliding motion between both shafts. Whereby, the friction loss between the output shaft 9 and the front drive shaft 34 can be prevented. Referring to FIG. 4, the front drive shaft 34 is rotatably supported at the front end thereof by the transmission case 3a through an angular contact type ball bearing 51 and the output shaft 9 incorporating the front drive shaft therein is rotatably supported at the rear end thereof by the transmission case 3a through a roller bearing 52. A needle thrust bearing 53 is provided at the front end of the output shaft 9 in order to bear a thrust load from the front drive shaft 34. As shown in FIG. 3, an axial force is applied in a direction marked A from the front final reduction-gear unit 5 to the front drive shaft 34 through the orthogonal gear 35 and further applied to the angular contact type ball bearing 51. On the other hand, an axial force is applied from the power transmission gear trains to the thrust bearing 53 of the output shaft 9. When the vehicle travels straightforwardly, since there is no relative rotation between the output shaft 9 and the front drive shaft 34, the durability of the bearing can be enhanced. The shift gear trains from the first to fifth gear ratios, the connection gear train and the front drive gear train, are constituted by helical gears. When a certain pair of gears are transmitting power, a component force as indicated by an arrow B in FIG. 3 is exerted on the teeth flank of working gears in a reverse direction to the arrow A. Accordingly, a reaction force is exerted on the output shaft 9 in a direction canceling the axial force A originating from the front final reduction gear unit 5. As a result, the axial load applied to the bearing 51 is reduced and a ball bearing can be used instead of a tapered roller bearing. As a result, the power transmission efficiency is enhanced and the fuel economy goes up. As shown in FIG. 4, the front drive shaft 34 is constituted by two portions, a portion 34a on which the orthogonal gear 35 is provided and a portion 34b on which the driven gear 37 is provided and these two portions are coupled with each other by a serration 30. The driven gear 37 is supported at the front end thereof by the rear end of the output shaft 9 through a thrust bearing. FIG. 5 is a skeleton diagram showing a manual transmission for a four-wheel drive vehicle according to another embodiment of the present invention. This transmission has six forward speeds. In the transmission, drive gears 11, 12, 13, 14 and 16 are mounted on the input shaft 8 for first, second, third, fourth gear ratios respectively and driven gears 21, 22, 23, 24 and 26 constantly meshing with the drive respective gears are mounted on the output shaft 9. A connection gear train is formed by a driven gear 15 integrally mounted on the intermediate shaft 10 and a drive gear 25 integrally mounted on the output shaft 9. The gear ratio of the connection gear train is 1.0. The second clutch 32 changes over the shift gear train between the third gear ratio and the fourth gear ratio and the third clutch 33 changes over the gear train between the fifth gear ratio and the sixth gear ratio. The transmission according this embodiment has a similar structure to that shown in FIG. 1 except for the number of shift gear trains. The components of the transmission which are identical in both drawings FIG. 2 and FIG. 5 are denoted by identical reference numbers. FIG. 6 is a skeleton diagram showing a manual transmission for a four-wheel drive vehicle according to a further embodiment of the present invention. The components identical in both drawings FIG. 1 and FIG. 6 are denoted by identical reference numbers. This transmission has five forward speed ratios in the same way as that shown in FIG. 2. The transfer unit 40 is formed only by a multiple disc clutch or a viscous coupling 42 but has no center differential unit. The intermediate 10 is connected at the rear end thereof with a rear drive section 39. Further, the rear drive section 39 is connected at the rear end thereof with the propeller shaft 6. Also in the transmissions shown in FIG. 5 and FIG. 6, in the same manner as the transmission shown in FIG. 2, since the transfer unit 40 is coaxially coupled with the input shaft 8 and is disposed above the output shaft 9, the agitating resistance of lubrication oil is prevented from being exerted on the output shaft 9. Further, since a large axial force is prevented from being applied to the bearing for supporting the front drive shaft 34, the power transmission efficiency can be enhanced. Further, when the vehicle travels straightforwardly, since a relative rotation does not generate between the output shaft 9 and the front drive shaft 34 incorporated in the output shaft 9, the power transmission efficiency can be raised.

Description BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to an automatic transmission for a vehicle and, more particularly, an automatic transmission installed longitudinally in the engine room on the basis of the mechanism of the manual transmission. In case the power unit containing the transmission is arranged longitudinally in the engine room, i.e., in case the power unit is arranged such that the input shaft and the output shaft of the transmission are directed in parallel with the running direction of the vehicle, such power unit is arranged as disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. Hei 7-167257, for example. The power unit disclosed in this Publication is prepared for the four-wheel-drive vehicle. The engine, the clutch housing into which the clutch is incorporated, the transmission main body into which the final reduction gear for driving the front wheel is incorporated, and the transfer unit having the power transfer mechanism of the front and rear wheels are arranged in the engine room in this order from the front side of the vehicle. The power is transmitted from the rear end portion of the transmission to the driving unit that transmits the power to the rear wheel. The transmission disclosed in this Publication is the manual transmission (MT). The selecting operation of the transmission gear train which transmits the power, out of plural transmission gear trains provided between the input shaft and the output shaft, is executed manually by the operator operating the shift lever. The selecting operation is carried out automatically by the hydraulic actuator in response to the running situation of the vehicle on the basis of the mechanism of such manual transmission. The Automated Manual Transmission (AMT) can be completed as disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. Toku-Kai 2000-65199, for example. In this automatic transmission, the shift clutch, i.e., the bypass clutch is provided to transmit the torque of the input shaft to the output shaft in synchronism with controls of the start clutch and the electronic throttle valve when the transmission gear train is switched by the changeover mechanism that consists of the synchronizer. This bypass clutch is fitted to the gear train at the highest shifting stage. Since the generation of the torque stop during the shifting operation is prevented, the shift shock can be reduced and thus the smooth shifting operation can be carried out. In this automatic transmission, the bypass clutch is fitted to the highest shifting stage of the parallel two-axle transmission gear train such that the torque of the input shaft is transmitted from the highest shifting stage to the output shaft during the shifting operation. In this case, the bypass clutch consisting of the multiple disc clutch must be provided between the transmission gear train at the highest shifting stage constructed at the rear end portion of the main transmission portion, and the transfer unit from the viewpoint of the space. For this reason, following subjects and disadvantages are caused. In case the bypass clutch is fitted to the drive train in which the transmission having the transfer unit at its rear end portion and the engine are arranged longitudinally in the engine room, length of the transmission is increased by the thickness dimension of the added bypass clutch. Since the transmission is extended in its axial direction, the rear end portion of the transmission becomes close to tunnel members of the carbody structure and the toe board. Therefore, since the carbody structure is designed with regard to the crash stroke in the crash, the carbody structure must be corrected to reduce the interior space. Also, the expansion of the transmission lowers the flexural rigidity of the transmission itself and thus the vibration and the noise of the drive train become worse. In addition, if either the manual transmission or the automatic transmission is installed into the vehicle having the same carbody structure, there is a possibility that the compatibility of the carbody structure is lost because their outer dimensions of the transmissions are different. This automatic transmission has the start clutch, the bypass clutch, the oil pump, and the hydraulic control mechanism. It is desired that these elements should be assembled closely by employing the hydraulic circuit that is able to arrange the start clutch and the bypass clutch around the oil pump as close as possible, or reducing the hydraulic circuit extended from the hydraulic control mechanism. However, in the automatic transmission disclosed in Japanese Patent Application-Laid-open No. Toku-kai 2000-65199, there is disclosed such a structure that the start clutch is provided in front of the transmission and also the bypass clutch is provided at the back of the transmission. Thus, the control hydraulic pressure is guided from the hydraulic control mechanism to the hydraulic chambers of respective clutches via the hydraulic circuits. As a result, when respective clutches are controlled by the hydraulic control mechanism arranged normally under the transmission, it is possible to worsen the responsibility because the hydraulic circuits are long. In particular, when the atmospheric temperature is low, such influence is ready to appear. In this manner, the functional disadvantages may be caused in the minute control of the start clutch to attain the smooth start, the momentary control of the hydraulic pressure of the bypass clutch during the shifting operation to get the smooth shifting operation, etc. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is an object of the present invention to provide an Automated Manual Transmission (AMT) constructed based on the structure of the manual transmission, which is capable of preventing the increase of the transmission in size in the axial direction and also improving the responsibility at the time of hydraulic control. An automatic transmission of the present invention comprising: an input shaft to which a plurality of driving gears are provided; an output shaft to which a plurality of driven gears are provided, the plurality of driven gears being engaged with the driving gears to constitute a plurality of transmission gear trains respectively; a changeover mechanism for selecting the desired transmission gear train which transmits a power, out of the plurality of transmission gear trains; a start clutch for setting an engine and the input shaft into an engage state and a disengage state; a driving shaft coupled to the output shaft in parallel with the output shaft, the driving shaft being coupled to a final reduction gear; and a bypass clutch arranged over the final reduction gear and transmitting a torque of the input shaft to the output shaft while controlling connection and disconnection in synchronism with a selecting operation of the transmission gear trains in a shifting operation, wherein the manual transmission is arranged longitudinally in an engine room in which the input shaft and the output shaft are arranged in a traveling direction of a vehicle. In the automatic transmission of the present invention, the bypass clutch comprises a plurality of bypass clutches provided between the input shaft and the output shaft, wherein at least one of the plurality of bypass clutches is arranged over the final reduction gear, and the driving shaft is arranged below the output shaft. In the automatic transmission of the present invention, the automatic transmission further comprises an oil pump driven by the engine to generate a hydraulic pressure which drives the start clutch and the bypass clutch, wherein the oil pump is arranged over the final reduction gear and near the bypass clutch. The automatic transmission having the final reduction gear is constructed to have three rotation shafts, and also the bypass clutch is installed over the final reduction gear. Therefore, an upper space of the final reduction gear can be effectively employed, and also the automatic transmission can be shortened in the axial direction. Since the oil pump can be arranged over the final reduction gear and near the bypass clutch, the upper space of the final reduction gear can be effectively employed and thus the hydraulic pressure source and the hydraulic actuator can be positioned closely. Therefore, the automatic transmission can be shortened in the axial direction and thus the responsibility in the hydraulic pressure control can be improved.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Embodiments of the present invention will be explained in detail with reference to the drawings hereinafter. FIG. 1 is a skeleton diagram showing an automatic transmission 10 as an embodiment of the present invention. As shown in FIG. 1, this automatic transmission 10 is coupled to an engine 11, and comprises an input shaft 14 coupled to the engine 11 via a torque converter 12 and a start clutch 13, an output shaft 16 positioned in parallel with the input shaft 14 and coupled to a center differential gear 15, and a front wheel driving shaft 17 and a rear wheel driving shaft 18 positioned in parallel with the input shaft 14 and coupled to the output shaft 16 via the center differential gear 15. One end portion of the rear wheel driving shaft 18, the input shaft 14, the output shaft 16, and the front wheel driving shaft 17 are incorporated into a case 20 to direct to the traveling direction of the vehicle. This automatic transmission 10 is applied to the four-wheel-drive vehicle in which such transmission is arranged longitudinally. The torque converter 12 having a lock-up clutch 21 is coupled to the engine 11. An oil pump 22 is coupled to the torque converter 12, and thus the oil pump 22 is driven by the engine 11. The start clutch 13 and a bypass clutch 24 are provided between a turbine shaft 23 which transmits the output of the torque converter 12, and the input shaft 14. This start clutch 13 switches the engage state in which the turbine shaft 23 is connected to the input shaft 14 and the disengage state in which the turbine shaft 23 is disconnected from the input shaft 14. This bypass clutch 24 transmits the drive torque of the input shaft 14 to the output shaft 16 while controlling it. An electronic throttle for adjusting the engine torque and the engine speed is provided to the engine 11. Normally the electronic throttle is opened/closed by the output signal which is output from the electronic device in response to an amount of pushing-down of an acceleration pedal (not shown), so that the engine control is carried out. Also, irrespective of the pushing-down of the acceleration pedal, the electronic throttle can be opened/closed based on the map set previously according to the sensed driving state, so that the engine control can be carried out. A start clutch drum 13a is fixed to the end portion of the turbine shaft 23, and a start clutch hub 13b is fixed to the end portion of the input shaft 14. Plural sheets of start clutch plates 13c are provided between the start clutch hub 13b and the start clutch drum 13a. The start clutch hub 13b and the start clutch drum 13a can be coupled by pushing the start clutch plates 13c, so that the power of the turbine shaft 23 can be transmitted to the input shaft 14. A bypass clutch hub 24b is fitted rotatably to the input shaft 14. Plural sheets of bypass clutch plates 24c are provided between the start clutch hub 13b, which is fixed to the end portion of the input shaft 14, and the bypass clutch hub 24b. Thus, the bypass clutch hub 24b and the start clutch hub 13b can be coupled by pushing the bypass clutch plates 24c. The start clutch hub 13b also functions as a bypass clutch drum. A bypass driving gear 30a is fixed to the bypass clutch hub 24b that is provided rotatably to the input shaft 14, and a bypass driven gear 30b is fixed to the output shaft 16. The bypass driving gear 30a and the bypass driven gear 30b are engaged mutually, and constitute the driving torque transmitting gear train to transmit the driving torque of the input shaft 14 the output shaft 16 when the bypass clutch 24 is coupled. Driving gears 31a, 32a as the first and second gears are fixed to the input shaft 14, and also driving gears 33a to 35a as the third to fifth gears are provided rotatably to the input shaft 14. Driven gears 31b, 32b as the first and second gears are provided rotatably to the output shaft 16, and also driven gears 33b to 35b as the third to fifth gears are fixed to the output shaft 16. The driving gears 31a to 35a and the driven gears 31b to 35b are engaged respectively to constitute the forward transmission gear train. A first changeover mechanism 41 for selecting the transmission gear train into one of the first gear and the second gear is mounted onto the output shaft 16, and a second changeover mechanism 42 for selecting the transmission gear train into one of the third gear and the fourth gear is mounted onto the input shaft 14. Also, a third changeover mechanism 43 for selecting the transmission gear train into the fifth gear is mounted onto the input shaft 14. The changeover mechanisms 41 to 43 are constructed as the synchromesh mechanisms in which synchro sleeves 41b to 43b provided slidably to synchro hubs 41a to 43a, are engaged synchronously with splines 31c to 35c provided integrally with gears 31b, 32b, 33a to 35a, respectively. The driving torque of the input shaft 14 can be transmitted to the output shaft 16 via the selected transmission gear train by operating respective changeover mechanisms 41 to 43. A reverse driving gear 36a is fixed to the input shaft 14, and a reverse driven gear 36b is fixed to the synchro sleeve 41b that is coupled to the output shaft 16. An idler gear 45a is mounted rotatably onto an idler shaft 45 that is arranged in parallel with the input shaft 14. A fourth changeover mechanism 44 for selecting the transmission gear train to the backward drive is provided to the idler gear 45a. The idler gear 45a can be slid in the axial direction by operating a changeover member 44a that is mounted onto this fourth changeover mechanism 44. The reverse driving gear 36a and the reverse driven gear 36b can be engaged with each other via the idler gear 45a by sliding the idler gear 45a. In this manner, the fourth changeover mechanism 44 is the slide-selection type changeover mechanism. The driving torque of the input shaft 14 can be transmitted to the output shaft 16 by operating this fourth changeover mechanism 44 after its rotating direction is reversed. A front wheel driving gear 47a and a rear wheel driving gear 48a are fixed to two bevel gears 46 of the center differential gear 15, which is a differential unit provided to the end portion of the output shaft 16, respectively. A front wheel driven gear 47b is provided integrally to the front wheel driving shaft 17. When the front wheel driven gear 47b is engaged with the front wheel driving gear 47a, the driving torque of the output shaft 16 can be transmitted to the front wheel driving shaft 17 via the center differential gear 15. Similarly, a rear wheel driven gear 48b is provided to the rear wheel driving shaft 18. When the rear wheel driving gear 48a is engaged with the rear wheel driven gear 48b, the driving torque of the output shaft 16 can be transmitted to the rear wheel driving shaft 18 via the center differential gear 15. Also, a friction clutch 49 that couples a diff-case 15a which is coupled to the output shaft 16, to the bevel gears 46 or decouples the diff-case 15a from the bevel gears 46 is installed into the center differential gear 15. When this friction clutch 49 is brought into the coupled state, the bevel gears 46 are engaged with bevel pinions 50. Therefore, a differential function of the center differential gear 15 does not operate, and thus the driving torque of the output shaft 16 can be transmitted to two driving shafts 17, 18 as it is. The front wheel driving shaft 17 is coupled to a front wheel drive shaft (not shown) via a front differential gear 51. Also, the rear wheel driving shaft 18 is coupled to a rear wheel drive shaft (not shown) via a rear differential gear (not shown). FIG. 2 is a sectional view showing a part of the automatic transmission 10. As shown in FIG. 1 and FIG. 2, the oil pump 22, the start clutch 13, and the bypass clutch 24 are arranged over the front differential gear 51 serving as the final reduction gear. As shown in FIG. 2, a piston 52 is fitted slidably between the start clutch drum 13a and the start clutch plates 13c provided to the start clutch 13. When the operating fluid is supplied to a hydraulic chamber 53 that consists of the start clutch drum 13a serving as a cylinder and the piston 52, the piston 52 can be slid to push the start clutch plates 13c. A stopper 54 is provided between the piston 52 and the start clutch hub 13b, and a spring member 55 is fitted between the piston 52 and the stopper 54 in the direction to release the pushing operation of the piston 52. When the hydraulic pressure in the hydraulic chamber 53 is released, the coupling of the start clutch 13 can be released. Also, a piston 56 is fitted slidably between the start clutch hub 13b serving as a bypass clutch drum and the bypass clutch plates 24c. When the operating fluid is supplied to a hydraulic chamber 57 that consists of the start clutch hub 13b serving as a cylinder and the piston 56, the piston 56 can be slid to push the bypass clutch plates 24c. A stopper 58 is provided between the piston 56 and the bypass clutch hub 24b, and a spring member 59 is fitted between the piston 56 and the stopper 58 in the direction to release the pushing operation of the piston 56. When the hydraulic pressure in the hydraulic chamber 57 is released, the coupling of the bypass clutch 24 can be released. The hydraulic control of such automatic transmission will be explained hereunder. FIG. 3 is a block diagram showing a hydraulic control mechanism of the automatic transmission 10 as one embodiment of the present invention. As shown in FIG. 3, the operation of the bypass clutch 24, the operation of the start clutch 13, and the operation of plural changeover mechanisms 41 to 44 are carried out by operating plural electromagnetic valves VA1 to VA6 which are incorporated into a valve unit 69 constituting the hydraulic control mechanism, and supplying/controlling the operating fluid to a bypass clutch actuator 61, a start clutch actuator 62, a select actuator 63, and a shift actuator 64. The operating fluid used to drive these actuators 61 to 64 is sucked from an oil reservoir provided to the bottom portion of the transmission by the gear type oil pump 22 and then supplied as the operating fluid pressure. A pressure regulating valve 66 is provided to a hydraulic system 65 that supplies the line pressure as the operating fluid pressure. When the line pressure is in excess of a predetermined value, the pressure regulating valve 66 is opened to guide the operating fluid to the oil reservoir. When the line pressure is below the predetermined value after various shifting operations are executed to consume the hydraulic pressure, the pressure regulating valve 66 is closed to increase the line pressure. A part of the operating fluid pressure is accumulated in an accumulator 67, so that the line pressure can be stabilized and also the minimum emergency operation can be executed even if the trouble of the oil pump 22, etc. are caused and troubles occur in the hydraulic system 65. Also, a signal is input from a pressure sensor 68 provided to the hydraulic system 65 to an ECU 69, and thus the line pressure is monitored by the ECU 69. Signals are input into the ECU 69 from an inhibitor switch 70, a speed sensor 71, an engine speed sensor 72, etc. The ECU 69 senses the position of the select lever selected by the driver based on the signal from the inhibitor switch 70. The ECU 69 also senses the speed based on the signal from the speed sensor 71. Then, the ECU 69 senses the engine speed based on the signal from the engine speed sensor 72. The ECU 69 senses the driving situation of the vehicle based on these sensed data and also outputs the signals to the valve unit 60 to drive/control the actuators 61 to 64 as the case may be. In this manner, the operating fluid supplied from the oil pump 22 is supplied to the bypass clutch actuator 61 via an electromagnetic pressure regulating valve VA1, and supplied to the start clutch actuator 62 via an electromagnetic pressure regulating valve VA2. In addition, the operating fluid is supplied to the select actuator 63 via an electromagnetic changeover valve VA3. An electromagnetic changeover valve VA4, and the operating fluid is supplied to the shift actuator 64 via an electromagnetic pressure regulating valve VA5 and an electromagnetic pressure regulating valve VA6. The engagement of the bypass clutch 24 is attained by the bypass clutch actuator 61. When the operating fluid pressure is supplied to the hydraulic chamber 57 of the bypass clutch actuator 61 and thus the piston 56 is slid by the hydraulic pressure, the bypass clutch plates 24c are pushed and thus the driving torque of the input shaft 14 can be transmitted to the output shaft 16. The engagement of the start clutch 13 is attained by the start clutch actuator 62. When the operating fluid pressure is supplied to the hydraulic chamber 53 of the start clutch actuator 62 and thus the piston 52 is slid by the hydraulic pressure, the start clutch plates 13c are pushed and thus the driving torque of the turbine shaft 23 can be transmitted to the input shaft 14. The selecting operation for selecting the transmission gear train, which transmits the power, from plural transmission gear trains is carried out by the shift actuator 64 and the select actuator 63. The selecting operation between the shift actuator 64 and the select actuator 63 can be transmitted to four changeover mechanisms 41 to 44 via a direction changing mechanism (not shown). The selecting operation of the shift actuator 64 is transmitted as the selecting operation of the transmission gear train shown in an arrow B direction in FIG. 3. That is, such selecting operation is given as the operation to switch the transmission gear train into one of the first gear and the second gear, one of the third gear and the fourth gear, or one of the fifth gear and the reverse gear. More particularly, the synchro sleeves 41b to 43b or a changeover member 44b is slid by such selecting operation. The selecting operation of the select actuator 63 is transmitted as the selecting operation of the transmission gear train shown in an arrow A direction in FIG. 3. That is, such selecting operation is given as the operation to select the object to which the selecting operation of the shift actuator 64 is transmitted. More particularly, such selecting operation decides which one of the synchro sleeves 41b to 43b and the changeover member 44b the selecting operation of the shift actuator 64 should be transmitted to. When the operation of the shift actuator 64 is transmitted to the first changeover mechanism 41, such shift actuator 64 is operated into a position at which the synchro sleeve 41b is engaged with the spline 31c to set the first gear, a position at which the synchro sleeve 41b is engaged with the spline 32c to set the second gear, or a neutral position at which the synchro sleeve 41b is engaged with these splines 31c, 32c. Similarly, when the operation of the shift actuator 64 is transmitted to the second changeover mechanism 42, such shift actuator 64 is operated into one of three positions, i.e., the third gear, the fourth gear, or the neutral position. In addition, when the operation of the shift actuator 64 is transmitted to the third changeover mechanism 43, such shift actuator 64 is operated into one of two positions, i.e., the fifth gear or the neutral position. Further, when the operation of the shift actuator 64 is transmitted to the fourth changeover mechanism 44, such shift actuator 64 is operated into one of two positions, i.e., the reverse gear or the neutral position. The reason for that the select actuator 63 is controlled by the electromagnetic changeover valves VA3, VA4 whereas the electromagnetic pressure regulating valves VA5, VA6 are employed to control the shift actuator 64 is the difference in the object operated by the actuator. When the actuator is controlled in the arrow A direction that is the control direction of the select actuator 63, such actuator may be simply controlled into three positions. In contrast, when the actuator is controlled in the arrow B direction that is the control direction of the shift actuator 64, the synchromesh mechanism must be operated. Thus the electromagnetic pressure regulating valves VA5, VA6 that can adjust finely the supplied hydraulic pressure must be employed in place of the ON/OFF control of the hydraulic pressure. Therefore, the shift actuator 64 is controlled strongly at the initial stage of its operation, controlled normally during the sychromesh-synchronization, and controlled weakly at the end stage of its operation. The hydraulic pressure control mechanism consists of the valve unit 60, the select actuator 63, the shift actuator 64, etc. to execute such hydraulic pressure control. The hydraulic pressure control mechanism is fitted in the range that is positioned at the back of the oil pump 22 shown in FIG. 1, and over the front differential gear 51 as the final reduction gear, and in front of a wall portion 75 formed around the almost center portion of the transmission. As for the operation control of the torque converter 12 having the lock-up clutch 21, the power of the engine 11 can be transmitted directly to the turbine shaft 23 by supplying the operating fluid pressure to an apply chamber 76 and a release chamber 77 of the lock-up clutch 21 in compliance with an output signal of the ECU 69, otherwise the power of the engine 11 can be transmitted to the turbine shaft 23 via the torque converter 12. The selecting operation of the transmission gear train in the transmission in FIG. 1 will be explained hereunder. The selecting of the first gear is carried out by engaging the synchro sleeve 41b of the first changeover mechanism 41 with the spline 31c by virtue of operations of the select actuator 63 and the shift actuator 64. At this time, the driving torque of the input shaft 14 is transmitted from the input shaft 14 to the output shaft 16 via the driving gear 31a, the driven gear 31b, and the first changeover mechanism 41. When the synchro sleeve 41b is engaged with the spline 32c, the transmission gear train is switched into the second gear. Similarly the selecting operations from the third gear to the fifth gear can be executed by operating the second changeover mechanism 42 or the third changeover mechanism 43. When the shifting operation is executed from the first gear to the second gear, such shifting operation is carried out via the neutral position of the first changeover mechanism 41, so that the situation that the driving torque cannot be transmitted temporarily from the input shaft 14 to the output shaft 16 is caused. Normally, when the gear ratio of respective transmission gear trains is decided, the gear ratio is lowered like the geometric series from the first gear to decide such that the revolution range of the engine 11 employed before and after each shift stage is selected to be kept constant. Accordingly, the difference in the gear ratio before and after the selecting is particularly large in the transmission gear train at the low speed stage, and thus the large acceleration change is caused in the vehicle by the shifting operation via the neutral state in contrast to the high speed stage. In order to suppress such acceleration change by preventing the torque stop of the output shaft 16 in the neutral state, the driving torque is transmitted to the output shaft 16 while controlling the connection/disconnection of the bypass clutch 24 in synchronism with the selecting operation. FIG. 4 is a view showing a relationship between an output shaft torque To and a bypass clutch torque Tb when the shifting is executed from the first gear to the second gear. As shown in FIG. 4, since the transmission of the output shaft torque To is shut off until the synchro sleeve 41b is separated from the spline 31c and then engaged with the spline 32c, the ECU 69 controls the engagement of the bypass clutch 24 to supplement the output shaft torque To at the same time when the synchro sleeve 41b is separated from the spline 31c. When the synchromesh mechanism starts to operate after the first changeover mechanism 41 is passed through the neutral state and then the generation of the output shaft torque To by the second gear is started, the ECU 69 starts to release the engagement of the bypass clutch 24 and then brings the bypass clutch 24 in its release state at the same time when the synchro sleeve 41b is engaged with the spline 32c. The bypass clutch 24 provided to the transmission shown in FIG. 1 is one, and is operated in the shifting operation at the low speed range in which the difference in the gear ratio is large. If the bypass clutch that can set the transmission torque to the high speed gear is added to the high speed range in which the difference in the gear ratio is gentle, the smooth shifting operation can be carried out over the full shift range. In contrast, the selecting of the reverse gear is executed by operating the select actuator 63 and the shift actuator 64 to operate the fourth changeover mechanism 44. Since the fourth changeover mechanism 44 is the slide-selection type changeover mechanism, the torque transmission of the input shaft 14 is cut off by bringing the start clutch 13 into its release state to disconnect the input shaft 14 from the turbine shaft 23 and then such fourth changeover mechanism 44 is operated. The changeover mechanisms 41 to 43 employed in the forward travel can be controlled into the neutral state in which they are not engaged with the splines 31a to 35a provided on both sides, so that they are controlled to prevent the event that plural changeover mechanisms 31 to 33 are engaged simultaneously in the running. In this case, the changeover mechanism 44 employed in the reverse travel is also controlled to operate only when the changeover mechanisms 41 to 43 are positioned in the neutral state. According to such automatic transmission 10, since the hydraulic pressure control mechanism consisting of the valve unit 60, the actuators 63, 64, etc. as the basic constituent elements in the automated transmission, the oil pump 22, the start clutch 13, and the bypass clutch 24 are arranged over the front differential gear 51 serving as the final reduction gear. Therefore, the basic constituent elements pursuant to the automated transmission can be installed without the provision of a new space. As a result such a situation can be suppressed that a total length of the automatic transmission 10 in the axial direction becomes longer than the manual transmission that constitutes the basic structure of this automatic transmission 10. Also, since the automatic transmission 10 is constructed to have three shafts of the input shaft 14, the output shaft 16 and the front wheel driving shaft 17, the final reduction gear and the gears can be installed to overlap with each other in the axial direction and thus the transmission can be shortened. In addition, since the valve unit 60 and the oil pump 22 for supplying the operating fluid pressure to the start clutch 13 and the bypass clutch 24 are positioned collectively, the responsibility in control can be improved. The above embodiment of the present invention is not limited, and it is needless to say that the present invention can be changed variously in the scope not to depart from the gist of the invention. For example, the employment of the bypass clutch 24 is not limited in the shifting operation in the low speed range, and the bypass clutch 24 may be employed in the high speed range. In order to shift smoothly the full shifting gears, plural bypass clutches may be provided and at least one bypass clutch may be provided over the front differential gear 51 serving as the final reduction gear. The illustrated automatic transmission 10 is employed in the longitudinal type four-wheel-drive vehicle, but it may be employed in the two-wheel-drive vehicle. In addition, the illustrated automatic transmission 10 is of the five forward gears/one reverse gear type, but the present invention is not limited to this transmission gear number. The automatic transmission is constructed to have three shafts of the input shaft, the output shaft, and the driving shaft having the final reduction gear, and also the bypass clutch as the basic constituent element of the automatic transmission is installed over the final reduction gear. Therefore, the automatic transmission can be realized not to extend the axial length rather than the manual transmission as the basic structure. Since the oil pump can be arranged over the final reduction gear and near the bypass clutch, the hydraulic pressure source and the hydraulic actuator can be positioned closely. Therefore, the responsibility in the hydraulic pressure control can be improved. * * * * *",

No. 09/765,762 filed Jan. 18, 2001. The entire disclosure of which is considered as being part of the disclosure of this continuing divisional application and is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Claims What is claimed is: 1. An automobile transmission for transmitting driving force of an engine to wheels while changing a rotation speed of a crankshaft of said engine, comprising; a main shaft connected with said crankshaft through a clutch and having a plurality of first drive gears; a counter shaft provided below and in parallel with said main shaft and having first driven gears meshing with said first drive gears and having a second drive gear; a drive shaft provided below and in parallel with said counter shaft and having a second driven gear meshing with said second drive gear; a front differential provided at a front end of said drive shaft; a transmission case for accommodating said main shaft, said counter shaft, said drive shaft and said front differential; and a space formed in a front part of said transmission case; and a center differential provided at a rear end of said counter shaft for distributing a driving force into one for front wheels and one for rear wheels; and an extension case connected with a rear end of said transmission case for accommodating said center differential. 2. The transmission according to claim 1, further comprising; a sub transmission accommodated in said space for transmitting driving force of said engine to said main shaft through said counter shaft while reducing said rotation speed of said engine. 3. The transmission according to claim 2, wherein said sub transmission includes reduction gears mounted on said main shaft and said counter shafts. Description BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a transmission for a vehicle and more particularly to an automobile transmission which can be assembled using components shared among a plurality of transmission types. 2. Discussion of Prior Arts A transmission for transmitting engine power to driving wheel and for changing engine rotational speeds, is connected with a crankshaft of an engine through a clutch and has a main shaft and a counter shaft provided in parallel with the main shaft. The main shaft is provided with a plurality of driving gears and the counter shaft is provided with a plurality of driven gears meshing with the driving gears. When a driver operates a shift lever, a power transmission path obtained by a gear set of a driving gear and driven gear is established. There is no difference in the basic construction between a transmission for front wheel drive vehicle and one for four wheel drive vehicle. In case where the engine is mounted in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle, since the transmission is connected with the rear end of the engine, a power unit of the combination of the engine and transmission is required to reduce its own length so as to secure a space utility of the passenger compartment of the vehicle. To reduce the length of such a power unit, Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. Toku-Kai-Hei 1-156134 discloses a drive train for automobile in which a longitudinally mounted engine is slanted in the widthwise direction and a final reduction gear unit or a differential separated from the transmission is disposed on the slanted side of the engine. In this case, the axle shaft penetrates the side wall of an oil pan and crankcase of the engine. Further, Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. Toku-Kai-Hei 7-167257 discloses a technique in which the final reduction gear unit is integrated with the transmission. This type of drive train is characterized in a simple layout and a good mountability. On the other hand, a multiple speed ratio transmission is required in market from the view point of vehicle performance. Particularly, in case of four wheel drive vehicles, a multiple speed ratio transmission or a dual range transmission is strongly requested. For example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. Toku-Kai-Shou 55-4293 proposes a dual range type transmission having a sub-transmission between the crankshaft and the main shaft so as to change over the rotation speed of the crankshaft into two stages, Low and High, with respect to the main shaft. In order to raise a productivity of transmissions, it is required that components of the transmission are shared between a plurality of models or body types. For example, it is required that components common to both front wheel drive vehicles and four wheel drive vehicles are used on assembling transmissions. In response to these requirements, as disclosed in Toku-Kai-Hei 1-156134, in case where the final reduction gear unit is disposed on the side of the engine, the axle shaft penetrates the side walls of the oil pan and the crankcase. Accordingly, an attempt to apply a dual transmission mechanism to this type transmission elongates the longitudinal size the transmission and as a result the layout of the drive train becomes more complicated. Further, as shown in Toku-Kai-Hei 7-167257, in case where the final reduction gear unit is integrated with the transmission, the layout of the drive train is simplified, however since generally a front drive shaft is fitted to the hollow counter shaft, the length of the transmission increases. It is disadvantageous in length that a multiple speed ratio gearing mechanism or a dual range mechanism is further incorporated into the transmission. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is an object of the present invention to provide a transmission whose drive train layout is simple, even in case where a multiple speed ratio transmission mechanism or a dual range mechanism is incorporated into the transmission. It is another object of the present invention to provide a compact transmission easy to be mounted on a vehicle. It is further object of the present invention to share components among a plurality of transmission types in order to reduce manufacturing cost of the transmission. To achieve these objects, the present invention comprises a main shaft connected with a crankshaft of an engine through a clutch and having a plurality of first drive gears, a counter shaft provided below and in parallel with the main shaft and having first driven gears meshing with the first drive gears and having a second drive gear, a drive shaft provided below and in parallel with the counter shaft and having a second driven gear meshing with the second drive gear, a front differential provided at a front end of the drive shaft, a transmission case for accommodating the main shaft, the counter shaft, the drive shaft and the front differential, a space formed in a front part of the transmission case, a center differential provided at a rear end of the counter shaft for distributing driving force into driving force for front wheels and driving force for rear wheels, a sub transmission accommodated in the space for transmitting driving force of the engine to the main shaft while reducing the rotation speed of the engine.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Referring to FIG. 1, numeral 4 denotes a transmission case including a front transmission case 1, an intermediate transmission case 2 and a rear transmission case 3. The transmission case 4 is connected at the front end thereof with an engine 5 which is longitudinally mounted in an engine room and is connected at the rear end thereof with an extension case 6. An input shaft 7 is rotatably supported by a bearing 1b provided in a front wall 1a of the front transmission case 1. The input shaft 7 is connected with a flywheel 9 which is mounted on a crankshaft 8 of the engine 5 through a clutch 10. Further, the input shaft 7 is spline-fitted to a clutch hub 10a. A main shaft 11 extends coaxially with the input shaft 7 in the longitudinal direction of a vehicle and is rotatably mounted in the transmission case 4. The main shaft 11 is rotatably fitted at a front end thereof to a rear end of the input shaft 7 and is supported by the bearing 1b through the input shaft 7. Further, the main shaft 11 is supported at a rear end thereof by a bearing 3a provided in the rear transmission case 3. Furthermore, the main shaft 11 is supported at an intermediate portion thereof by a bearing 2a. Further, a counter shaft 12 is rotatably mounted in the transmission case 4 in parallel with and below the main shaft 11. The counter shaft 12 is supported at a front end thereof by a bearing 1c provided in the front transmission case 1 and is supported at a rear end thereof by a bearing 3b provided in the rear transmission case 3. A main transmission section 13 having five forward speeds is formed by gear sets provided between the main shaft 11 and the counter shaft 12 in the intermediate transmission case 2 and the rear transmission case 3. Further, a sub transmission 14 having two ranges of speed, high and low, is formed by gear sets provided between the input shaft 7, the main shaft 11 and the counter shaft 12 in the front transmission case 1. The sub transmission 14 has an input gear 15 mounted on the input shaft 7, a driven gear 16 rotatably mounted on the main shaft 11 and a counter sleeve 19 rotatably mounted on the counter shaft 12 through a needle bearing. The counter sleeve 19 includes a counter gear 17 constantly meshing with the input shaft 15 and a low range gear 18 constantly meshing with the driven gear 16. There is provided a range changeover section 20 composed of a synchromesh having a sleeve 20a (see FIG. 2) and the like between the input gear 15 and the driven gear 16. When the range switching section 20 operates to engage the sleeve 20a with a spline of the input shaft 7, the input shaft 7 is connected with the main shaft 11. On the other hand, when the sleeve 20a is engaged with a spline of the driven gear 16, the rotation of the input shaft 7 is transmitted to the main shaft 11 through counter sleeve 19, while the rotation speed is reduced by a gear ratio, thereby a low range is obtained. Thus constituted sub transmission 14 can utilize the counter shaft 12 of the main transmission 13 as a counter shaft for the sub transmission 14 without providing a counter shaft dedicated to the sub transmission. Accordingly, a longitudinal size of the overall transmission can be saved. Further, since a counter shaft dedicated to the subtransmission can be abolished, the number of parts can be reduced. In the main transmission section 13, the main shaft 11 is provided with a first (1.sup.st) speed gear 21, a second (2.sup.nd) speed gear 22 which rotate integrally therewith and a third (3.sup.rd) speed gear 23 and a fourth speed gear (4.sup.th) which rotate freely thereabout. Further, the main shaft 11 is provided with a reverse gear 26 which rotates integrally therewith. Further, in the front transmission case 1, a fifth (5.sup.th) speed gear 25 is rotatably mounted on the main shaft 11 adjacent to the sub transmission section 14. A driven gear 21a constantly meshing with the first speed gear 21 and a driven gear 22a constantly meshing with the second speed gear 22 are rotatably mounted on the counter shaft 12. Further, a driven gear 23a constantly meshing with the third speed gear 23, a driven gear 24a constantly meshing with the fourth speed gear 24 and a driven gear 25a constantly meshing with the fifth speed gear 25 are securedly mounted on the counter shaft 12 to rotate integrally with the shaft 12. The counter shaft 12 is provided with a synchromesh 27 having a sleeve 27a and the like between the driven gears 21a and 22a. When the sleeve 27a is engaged with a spline of the driven gear 21a, the rotation of the main shaft 11 is transmitted to the counter shaft 12 through the first speed gear 21. When the sleeve 27a is engaged with a spline of the driven gear 22a, the rotation of the main shaft 11 is transmitted to the counter shaft 12 through the first speed gear 22. The sleeve 27a of the synchromesh 27 meshes with a reverse gear 26 through a reverse idle gear (not shown). The main shaft 11 is provided with a synchromesh 28 having a sleeve 28a and the like between the third speed gear 23 and the fourth speed gear 24. When the sleeve 28a is engaged with a spline of the third speed gear 23, the rotation of the main shaft 11 is transmitted to the counter shaft 12 through the third speed gear 23. When the sleeve 28a is engaged with a spline of the fourth speed gear 24, the rotation of the main shaft 11 is transmitted to the counter shaft 12 through the fourth speed gear 24. The main shaft 12 is provided with a synchromesh 29 having a sleeve 29a and the like adjacent to the fifth speed gear 25. When the sleeve 29a is engaged with a spline of the fifth speed gear 25, the rotation of the main shaft 11 is transmitted to the counter shaft 12. Thus, since the main transmission 13 has shift stages of five forward speeds and the sub transmission 14 has two speed ranges, high and low, this transmission is a dual range transaxle type transmission having shift stages of ten forward speeds in total. Referring to FIG. 3, there is provided a spline hole at the rear end of the counter shaft 12. The spline hole is engaged with an input shaft 31 of a center differential 30. Accordingly, the output of the main and sub transmissions 13, 14 is inputted to the center differential 30 through the counter shaft 12. The input shaft 31 is supported by bearings 3c and 6a. The center differential 30 has a pinion shaft 33 fixedly penetrating the input shaft 31 in the radial direction thereof and secured to a differential case 32. Differential pinions 34, 35 are rotatably mounted on the pinion shaft 33 and mesh with differential-side gears 36, 37, respectively. There is provided a viscous coupling 38 between the side gear 36 and the differential case 32. The differential side gear 36 is spline-fitted over a rear drive gear 39 which is rotatably mounted on the input shaft 31 through a needle bearing. The rear drive gear 39 meshes with a driven gear 42 of a rear wheel drive shaft or a rear drive shaft 41 rotatably supported by the extension case 6 through bearings 6b, 6c. The other differential side gear 37 is spline-fitted over a front drive gear 43 which is rotatably mounted on the counter shaft 12 through a needle bearing. The front drive gear 43 meshes with a driven gear 45 of a front wheel drive shaft or a front drive shaft 44 rotatably supported by bearings 1d, 3d. As shown in FIG. 2, a front differential 46 is incorporated in the front transmission case 1. The front differential 46 includes a hypoid gear 46 which meshes with a hypoid pinion 48 secured to the front end of the front drive shaft 44. Further, as shown in FIG. 1, the rear drive shaft 41 is connected with a rear differential 49 through a propeller shaft. Thus, the driving torque distributed by the center differential 30 is transmitted to front and rear wheels through the front and rear differentials 46, 49, respectively. The front transmission case 1 has a space 50a partitioned by the intermediate transmission case 2 in the upper part thererof. This space 50a provides a sub transmission chamber accommodating the sub transmission 14 and the fifth speed gear 25 for high range. In the lower part of the front transmission case 1, a differential chamber 50b for accommodating the front differential 46 is formed. As shown in FIG. 3, the partition wall between the rear end of the rear transmission case 3 and the bearing 6c is provided with an oil pump 51, whose drive shaft is connected with the rear end of the main shaft 11. Thus, the oil pump 51 is driven by the main shaft 11. The drive shaft of the oil pump 51 has a hollow hole through which oil is discharged. The discharged oil is supplied to hollow holes provided in the center of axis of the main shaft 11 and the counter shaft 12, that is, lubrication oil passages, to lubricate components of the transmission. Referring to FIG. 4, the counter shaft 12 is positioned below the main shaft 11 and its center of axis is offset by S1 in an one widthwise direction of the vehicle. Further, the front drive shaft 44 is offset by S2 in the other widthwise direction of the vehicle. This arrangement of the shafts 11, 12 and 44 is effective for reducing the vertical size of the transmission case 4. Since in thus constructed transmission the front drive shaft 44 is arranged below the counter shaft 12 differently from a type of transmission in which the front drive shaft 44 is incorporated into the counter shaft 12, the sub transmission 14 can be incorporated between the main shaft 11 and the counter shaft 12 and at the same time the front differential 46 can be incorporated into the front transmission case 1 without enlarging the longitudinal size of the transmission. Further, since the longitudinal size of the transmission is reduced, an interior space of the passenger compartment can be secured and a power unit having a good mountability onto the vehicle is obtained. A front wall 1a of the front transmission case 1 facing the clutch 10 is provided with bearings 1b, 1c. As shown in FIG. 4, since each of the transmission case 1, the intermediate transmission case 2 and the rear transmission case 3 has a cylinder-like configuration enclosing the main shaft 11 and the like peripherally, the strength of the transmission case 4 can be increased, compared to the transmission case having a longitudinal mating surface. Further, since these transmission cases 1, 2 and 3 have a drum-like configuration respectively, the transmission can be assembled in an upright position and as a result the work efficiency is enhanced. Next, describing a second embodiment by reference to FIGS. 5 and 6, this manual transmission is applied to a four wheel drive vehicle similarly to the first embodiment but it is not provided with a sub transmission 14. In these drawings, the components identical both to the first and second embodiments are denoted by identical reference numbers. Accordingly, the transmission does not include an input gear 15, a driven gear 16, a counter sleeve 19 and a range changeover section 20. Further, since the transmission has no sub transmission, the input shaft 7 is replaced with a main shaft 11a. As shown in FIG. 6, a front end of the main shaft 11a is spline-fitted to a clutch hub 10a. On the other hand, since this transmission has the same structure as the transmission of FIG. 3 except the components for the sub transmission including the configuration of the front transmission 1, transmission components can be shared with other types of transmission. Thus, transmissions with and without sub transmission can be assembled using common parts. FIG. 7 is a skeleton diagram of an automobile manual transmission according to a third embodiment and FIG. 8 is a sectional view showing a rear part of the manual transmission. In these drawings, the components identical both to the second and third embodiments are denoted by identical reference numbers. This manual transmission is applied to a front drive vehicle and the construction of the transmission according to this embodiment has the same construction as a transmission portion excepting a four wheel drive mechanism of the transmission according to the second embodiment. In place of the extension case 6 of the second embodiment, a cover 52 is attached to the rear end of the transmission case 4. Further, another type of a front drive gear 43a is mounted on the counter shaft 12. Thus, a transmission dedicated to the front drive vehicle is obtained. In the transmission having no sub transmission as shown in FIGS. 5 and 7, by incorporating gears for 6.sup.th or more speed ratios into the space 50a, it is possible to realize a multiple speed ratio transmission with 6.sup.th or more speed ratios. In the preferred embodiments described before, a manual transmission is primarily exemplified; however other types of transmission, for example, an automatic transmission may be replaced with the manual transmission. That is, the present invention may be applied also to the automatic transmission. In summary, according to the present invention, components such as a transmission case, gear trains and the like can be shared among a transmission for four wheel drive vehicle with sub transmission, a transmission for four wheel drive vehicle without sub transmission and a transmission for front drive vehicle. Further, since the differential is incorporated in the transmission case and left and right axle shafts for transmitting driving force to left and right wheels respectively can have an identical length and therefore these axle shafts can be shared with each other. While the presently preferred embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described, it is to be understood that these disclosures are for the purpose of illustration and that various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims. * * * * *",

Description BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a hydraulic control apparatus of an automatic transmission mounted on a motor vehicle, and more particularly to a technique applied to the automatic transmission having a plurality of transmission gear trains. The present application claims priority from Japanese Patent Application No. 2001-180976, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes. 2. Description of the Related Art A manual transmission (MT) executing a gear shift operation by a manual operation of a driver includes an input shaft connected to an engine and to which a plurality of drive gears are attached, and an output shaft connected to a drive wheel and to which a plurality of driven gears forming pairs together with the drive gears are attached, in which a plurality of transmission gear trains are provided between the input and output shafts. In the MT, a gear shift operation, i.e., a gear change is performed by manually switching a switching mechanism such as a synchromeshed mechanism in order to switch a gear train, that is, a gear pair among a plurality of the transmission gear trains after disengaging a clutch at a time of the gear change, thereafter connecting the clutch. When the gear change and clutch operation are performed by using a shift actuator actuated by an oil pressure, an automatic transmission can be obtained whose structure is based on a manual transmission. An automatic transmission of a type having a plurality of transmission gear trains (Automated Manual Transmission, hereinafter referred to as an AMT) has some advantages in comparison with an ordinary torque converter type automatic transmission (AT) having a planetary gear in an automatic gear change mechanism. Namely, it is possible to reduce the number of parts, thereby lightening it, and the transmitting efficiency of a drive system is higher than that of the automatic transmission of the ordinary torque converter type. For example, Japanese Patent Application Laid Open No. 2000-55184 discloses such an AMT-type automatic transmission which has a starting clutch, that is, an input clutch for switching over from an engaged state to disengaged state and vice versa between a crank shaft and an input shaft of the engine, and a bypass clutch of a hydraulic multi-disc type for preventing a torque disconnection when transmitting a torque from the input shaft to the output shaft at the time of a gear shift operation. The AMT disclosed in this publication performs such a fail safe system that a first gear stage is forcibly setted by a return spring when an oil pump constituting an oil pressure source fails. In the conventional fail safe system, however, when a solenoid valve becomes uncontrollable as a result of an electrical system failure, a gear change to a first gear stage is forcibly made even while a vehicle is traveling in a fifth gear stage with a wet multi-disc clutch engaged, and thus it results in that not only a sudden drop in speed is caused and thereby the vehicle become unstable, but also such problems as wear or scorching of the starting clutch occurs in case of a half clutch position. Furthermore, as the conventional fail safe system is directed only for a forward travel, the fail safe system in a reverse travel has not ever been considered to be applied. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An object of the present invention is to enable a gear shift to a transmission gear train used for backward moving to be reliably performed without gear clashes or interlocking when a reverse range is selected by a manual operation, even if an electrical system failure occurs in an automatic transmission having a plurality of transmission gear trains. A hydraulic control circuit of the present invention has an input shaft on which a plurality of drive gears are provided, an output shaft on which a plurality of driven gears are provided to form the transmission gear trains by meshing with the drive gears, and a plurality of switching mechanisms for switching transmission gear trains transmitting drive power from the input shaft to the output shaft. As features of the present invention, it comprises an input clutch for engaging and disengaging between an engine and the input shaft, a select actuator for selecting either one of the plurality of switching mechanisms to perform a switching operation, a shift actuator for performing the switching operation of the selected switching mechanism, and a select position detection valve for opening and closing an oil passage under an engagement with the select actuator. It further comprises a shift position detection valve for switching the oil passages under an engagement with the shift actuator, the shift position detection valve supplying oil pressure for switching into a reverse gear stage to the select actuator when the shift actuator is actuated to a neutral position, and a forcible reverse shift valve for setting the shift actuator at a reverse gear stage by the oil pressure from the select position detection valve when the select actuator is switched to a reverse position. Thus, the oil pressure is supplied to the input clutch via the shift position detection valve when the reverse gear stage is setted by the shift actuator. The hydraulic control circuit of the present invention further comprises a normally open solenoid valve for controlling a supply of the oil pressure to allow the select actuator to be actuated to the reverse position, and a normally closed solenoid valve for controlling supply of the oil pressure to allow the select actuator to be actuated to a forward travel position. According to the present invention, in the case that the selector lever is setted at the reverse gear stage, it is possible to actuate the select actuator to the reverse position after the shift actuator is actuated to the neutral position, and then to engage the input clutch after the shift actuator is actuated to the reverse position, thereby enabling switching to a reverse gear stage to be reliably performed without the gear clashes or interlocking. Even in a case where a solenoid valve for switching the transmission gear train does not operate due to the electrical system failure, it is possible to actuate the select actuator to the reverse position after the shift actuator is actuated to the neutral position, and then to engage the input clutch after the shift actuator is actuated to the reverse position only by a manual operation, that is, by only setting the select lever at the reverse gear stage, thereby enabling the switching to the reverse gear stage to be reliably performed without the gear clashes or interlocking.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS An embodiment of the present invention will be described hereinafter with reference to the drawings. FIG. 1 is a skeleton view showing an automatic transmission having a hydraulic control apparatus as a first embodiment of the present invention, and FIG. 2 is a skeleton view showing a meshing state of gears, as seen along the line A--A in FIG. 1. The automatic transmission has an input shaft 11 coupled with an engine 10, and an output shaft 12 which lies in parallel with the input shaft 11 and is coupled with driving wheels. The input shaft 11 and the output shaft 12 are assembled within a transmission case (not shown) so as to face in a forward travel direction of a motor vehicle. The automatic transmission can be applied to a four-wheel drive vehicle and disposed in a longitudinal direction of the vehicle. A torque converter 15 having a lockup clutch 14 is coupled to a crank shaft 13 of the engine 10. A multi-disc type starting clutch, namely, an input clutch 17 is provided to engage or disengage between a turbine shaft 16, which is the output shaft of the torque converter 15, and an input shaft 11. First to third speed drive gears 21a to 23a are fixed to the input shaft 11, and fourth to sixth speed drive gears 24a to 26a are rotatably mounted with respect to the input shaft 11. The output shaft 12 has first to third speed driven gears 21b to 23b rotatably mounted thereon, and fourth to sixth speed driven gears 24b to 26b fixed thereto, and thus the driven gears mesh with corresponding drive gears 21a to 26a, respectively, to form transmission gear trains in a forward travel stage. A driven gear 27 for a backward travel is rotatably mounted on the output shaft 12. As shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, an idler shaft 28, which is disposed in parallel with and rotatably on the output shaft 12, is provided with an idler gear 28a that meshes with the first speed drive gear 21a and the driven gear 27 for the backward travel. Thus, the first speed drive gear 21a and the driven gear 27 for the backward travel mesh with one another via the idler gear 28a, so that the transmission gear train of the reverse gear is formed. In the other words, the drive gear 21a is employed not only as the first speed drive gear, but also as the reverse drive gear. A first bypass clutch 31 is provided on the output shaft 12. The first bypass clutch 31 has a clutch hub 31a fixed to the third speed driven gear 23b, and a clutch drum 31b fixed to the output shaft 12. As a result of pressurizing a plurality of clutch discs provided one by one on the clutch hub 31a and clutch drum 31b, the bypass clutch 31 enters an engaged state, or a power transmission state, so that the drive power of the input shaft 11 can be transmitted to the output shaft 12 via a third speed transmission gear train. Further, a second bypass clutch 32 is provided on the input shaft 11. The second bypass clutch 32 has a clutch hub 32a fixed to the sixth speed drive gear 26a, and a clutch drum 32b fixed to the input shaft 11. As a result of pressurizing a plurality of clutch discs provided one after another on the clutch hub 32a and clutch drum 32b, the bypass clutch 32 enters an engaged state, or a power transmission state, so that the drive power of the input shaft 11 can be transmitted to the output shaft 12 via a sixth speed transmission gear train. Transmission gear trains are therefore produced by enabling each of the drive gears 21a to 26a to mesh with the corresponding respective driven gears 21b to 26b, and 27, and thus a gear shift operation can be performed by switching the transmission gear train for transmitting the drive power. A first switching mechanism 41 for switching the transmission gear train to either the first speed or the second speed range is mounted on the output shaft 12, and a second switching mechanism 42 for switching the transmission gear train to either the fourth speed or the fifth speed range is mounted on the input shaft 11. In addition, a third switching mechanism 43 for switching the transmission gear train to a reverse gear stage is mounted on the output shaft 12. Each of the switching mechanisms 41 to 43 forms a synchromesh mechanism. However, the third switching mechanism 43 may be the one that uses a dog clutch mechanism. The first switching mechanism 41 has a synchronizer hub 41a, which is disposed between the two driven gears 21b, 22b of the first speed and second speed, and fixed to the output shaft 12; and a synchronizer sleeve 41b which continuously meshes with the synchronizer hub 41a. When the synchronizer sleeve 41b is caused to mesh with a spline 21c that is integrally formed with the driven gear 21b, the transmission gear train for transmitting the drive power is set at the first speed range, and conversely, the second speed range is setted when the synchronizer sleeve 41b is meshed with a spline 22c that is integrally formed with the driven gear 22b. Similarly, the second switching mechanism 42 has a synchronizer hub 42a, which is disposed between the two drive gears 24a, 25a of the fourth speed and the fifth speed ranges, and fixed to the input shaft 11; and a synchronizer sleeve 42b which continuously meshes with the synchronizer hub 42a. When the synchronizer sleeve 42b is meshed with a spline 24c that is integrally formed with the drive gear 24a, the transmission gear train is set at the fourth speed range, and conversely, the fifth speed range is set when meshing the synchronizer sleeve 42b with a spline 25c that is integrally formed with the drive gear 25a. Furthermore, the third switching mechanism 43 has a synchronizer hub 43a, which is disposed between the driven gear 26b of the sixth speed range and the driven gear 27 for the backward travel, and fixed to the output shaft 12; and a synchronizer sleeve 43b which continuously meshes with the synchronizer hub 43a. When the synchronizer sleeve 43b is meshed with a spline 27c that is integrally formed with the driven gear 27 for the backward travel, the transmission gear train is set to a reverse gear stage, and the drive power of the input shaft 11 is transmitted to the output shaft 12 via the idler gear 28a. Therefore, switching to the first speed or the second speed range is performed by actuating the synchronizer sleeve 41b of the first switching mechanism 41, and switching to the fourth speed or the fifth speed range is performed by actuating the synchronizer sleeve 42b of the second switching mechanism 42. Further, switching to the reverse gear stage is performed by actuating the synchronizer sleeve 43b of the third switching mechanism 43. Also, switching to the third speed range can be performed by engaging the first bypass clutch 31, and the switching to the sixth speed range by engaging the second bypass clutch 32. The automatic transmission has the bypass clutches 31, 32 and therefore can perform a gear shift operation while power is being transmitted via the bypass clutches 31, 32 with the input shaft 17 kept in an engaged state, so that torque loss at the time of a gear shift can be prevented. The automatic transmission has six forward travel transmission stages, where the first to third speed stages constitute a low speed stage group, and the fourth to sixth speed stages constitute a high speed stage group. When a gear shift operation is carried out in the low speed stage group, a torque transmission is performed from the input shaft 11 to the output shaft 12 with the first bypass clutch 31 in an engaged state. On the other hand, when the gear shift operation is carried out in the high speed stage group, the torque transmission is performed with the second bypass clutch 32 in the engaged state. Thus, the torque transmission passages are formed in separate systems through the two bypass clutches 31, 32 according to the transmission gear trains, thereby enabling the torque passing through the bypass clutches 31, 32 at the time of the gear shift operation to be transmitted through closer positions corresponding with the transmission gear train. A transfer device 44 having a friction clutch 44a is mounted on an end of the output shaft 12, and a rear wheel drive gear 46a is fixed to a transfer output shaft 45 of the transfer device 44. A rear wheel driven gear 46b is fixed to a rear wheel output shaft 47 provided in parallel with the transfer output shaft 45, and as a result of meshing between the rear wheel drive gear 46a and the rear wheel driven gear 46b, the drive power of the transfer output shaft 45 is transmitted to the rear wheel output shaft 47. The rear wheel output shaft 47 is coupled with a rear wheel drive shaft via a rear differential device (not shown), and the rear wheels can thus be driven by the drive power of the rear wheel output shaft 47. Meanwhile, a front wheel drive gear 48a is rotatably mounted on the output shaft 12, and a front wheel driven gear 48b, which meshes with the front wheel drive gear 48a, is fixed to a front wheel output shaft 49 provided in parallel with the output shaft 12. The front wheel drive gear 48a is coupled to the transfer output shaft 45 via the friction clutch 44a, and it is thus possible to transmit the drive power of the transfer output shaft 45 to the front wheel output shaft 49 by engaging the friction clutch 44a. The front wheel output shaft 49 is coupled to a front wheel drive shaft via a front differential device 50, and the front wheels can thus be driven by the drive power of the front wheel output shaft 49. An electronic control throttle for adjusting the engine torque and an engine speed is provided on the engine 10, and, normally, an engine control is performed by opening and closing the electronic control throttle through output signals from an electronic control device in accordance with a depressed degree of the accelerator pedal. Further, depending on requirements, the electronic control throttle is capable of performing the engine control by opening and closing thereof on the basis of a map setted in advance in accordance with detected drive states, irrespective of the depressed degree of the accelerator pedal. FIG. 3 is a schematic view showing a hydraulic control apparatus for controlling the operation of the automatic transmission described above. Hereinafter, the operation of the first to third switching mechanisms 41 to 43 will be explained. The automatic transmission selects a transmission gear train for performing a power transmission among a plurality of transmission gear trains, and thus is provided with a shift actuator 52 and a select actuator 53 in order to perform switching actions. The actions of the shift actuator 52 and the select actuator 53 are transmitted as the switching actions to the three switching mechanisms 41 to 43 via a directional converging mechanism (not shown) which has a shift link and a select link. As shown by an arrow B in FIG. 3, the action of the shift actuator 52 represents the switching of the transmission gear train to either the first or second gear, either the fourth or fifth gear, or the reverse gear. More specifically, this is an action constituting a switching movement in the synchronizer sleeves 41b to 43b. As shown by an arrow C in FIG. 3, the action of the select actuator 53 represents the selecting of a synchronizer sleeve 41b to 43b for performing the switching action among the three synchronizer sleeves 41b to 43b. By the shift actuator 52, the first switching mechanism 41 is positioned at any one of a position in which the synchronizer sleeve 41b meshes with the spline 21c to set the first speed range, the position in which the synchronizer sleeve 41b meshes with the spline 22c to set the second speed range, and the neutral position in which there is no meshing with the splines 21c, 22c. The second switching mechanism 42 is positioned at any one of the three positions, i.e., the fourth speed, the fifth speed ranges and the neutral position. Further, the third switching mechanism 43 is positioned at any one of two positions, i.e., the reverse and the neutral position. The actuation of these two actuators 52, 53 is controlled by a hydraulic control apparatus, which also controls an oil pressure with respect to the input clutch 17 and the two bypass clutches 31, 32. FIGS. 4 and 5 are both hydraulic circuit diagrams for the automatic transmission. FIG. 4 shows parts controlling each operation of the input clutch 17 and of the two bypass clutches 31, 32, and also FIG. 5 shows the parts controlling each operation of the shift actuator 52 and select actuator 53. In the hydraulic circuit diagrams, each circuit is connected by each portion with corresponding reference numerals 1 to 8. A select lever (not shown) operated by the driver is provided in a vehicle compartment, and a spool valve shaft 55s actuated by the select lever is provided at a manual valve 55. A line pressure oil passage 56 is connected with a line pressure port 55a formed in the manual valve 55, and also a line pressure supply section 57 having a pump and a pressure governor (not shown) for controlling the pressure at a predetermined line pressure. A D port 55b and an R port 55c are further provided in the manual valve 55. The D port 55b communicates with the line pressure port 55a when the manual valve 55 is moved to a position D corresponding to a drive range by the select lever. Also, the R port 55c communicates with the line pressure port 55a when the manual valve 55 is moved to a position R corresponding to the reverse range. A D port oil passage 58 and an R port oil passage 59 for guiding a line pressure thereof, respectively, are connected to the D port 55b and R port 55c. Further, when the manual valve 55 moves to a position N corresponding to a neutral range, the line pressure port 55a, the D port 55b and R port 55c are shut off. As shown in FIG. 5, the shift actuator 52 has a first piston 52p which is reciprocatable in an axial direction thereof, and ports 52a, 52b which communicate with oil chambers formed on both sides of the piston 52p, respectively. A solenoid valve SOL1 is provided in an actuating oil passage 60a which guides the actuating oil to the port 52a, and also a solenoid valve SOL2 is provided in an actuating oil passage 60b which guides the actuating oil to the port 52b. These two solenoid valves SOL1, SOL2 are both normally open type ones, that is, are normally open solenoid valves. When the solenoid valve SOL1 is energized, and also energization of the solenoid valve SOL2 is cut off, the actuating oil is supplied to the port 52b, and also the actuating oil is discharged from the port 52a, thereby moving the piston 52p of the shift actuator 52 in a leftward direction of FIG. 5. On the other hand, when the solenoid valve SOL2 is energized, and also energization of the solenoid valve SOL1 is cut off, the first piston 52p is moved rightwards. When the energization of the both solenoid valves SOL1, SOL2 is cut off, the oil chambers on both sides of the first piston 52p are then under the same pressure, so that the first piston 52p is held in an intermediate position. A rod 52r is provided on one end of the piston 52p of the shift actuator 52. When the rod 52r is driven by the first piston 52p in the leftward direction of FIG. 5, the synchronizer sleeves 41b to 43b shown in FIG. 1 can be actuated leftwards via a direction conversion mechanism. In other words, when the actuation is transmitted to the first switching mechanism 41 or the second switching mechanism 42, the transmission gear train can be setted at the first speed or the fourth speed range, respectively. Similarly, when the rod 52r is driven in a rightward direction in FIG. 5, the transmission gear train can be setted at the second speed range, fifth speed or the reverse gear, and when the rod 52r is held at the intermediate position, the synchronizer sleeves 41b to 43b are held at a neutral position in which there is no meshing with the splines 21c, 22c, 24c, 25c, and 27c. As shown in FIG. 5, the select actuator 53 has a second piston 53p which are reciprocatable in an axial direction thereof, and ports 53a, 53b which communicate with oil chambers formed on both sides of the second piston 53p, respectively. A solenoid valve SOL3 is provided in an actuating oil passage 61a which guides the actuating oil to the port 53a, and also a solenoid valve SOL4 is provided in an actuating oil passage 61b which guides the actuating oil to the port 53b. The solenoid valve SOL3 is of a normally open type, that is, is a normally open solenoid valve, and the solenoid valve SOL4 is the normally closed type, that is, is a normally closed solenoid valve. When these two solenoid valves SOL3, SOL4 are energized, the actuating oil is supplied to the port 53b, and also the the actuating oil is discharged from the port 53a, thereby moving the piston 53p of the select actuator 53 in the leftward direction of FIG. 5. On the other hand, when the energization of the two solenoid valves SOL3, SOL4 is cut off, the piston 53p is moved rightwards. When the energization of the solenoid valve SOL3 is cut off and the solenoid valve SOL4 is energized, the oil chambers on both sides of the piston 53p are then under the same pressure, so that the piston 53p is held in the intermediate position. A rod 53r is provided at one end of the piston 53p of the select actuator 53. When the rod 53r is driven by the piston 53p in the leftward direction, constituting a forward travel position, of FIG. 5, the first switching mechanism 41 is selected via the direction conversion mechanism, and the action of the shift actuator 52 described above can be transmitted to the first switching mechanism 41. Similarly, when the rod 53r is held at the intermediate position, the second switching mechanism 42 is selected, and also when the rod 53r is driven rightwards to adopt a reverse position, the third switching mechanism 43 is selected. Further, a select position detection valve 62 is provided adjacent to the select actuator 53. The select position detection valve 62 has a spool valve shaft 62s which is coupled to the piston 53p and provided slidably in an axial direction thereof, where there are further provided an input port 62b to which the line pressure is inputted from the R port 55c of the manual valve 55, and an output port 62a which outputs the line pressure. The spool valve shaft 62s causes the input port 62b and the output port 62a to communicate only when the piston 53p of the select actuator 53 is moved in a rightward direction of FIG. 5, the input port 62b and the output port 62a being shut off at the other positions. That is, the line pressure, which is outputted from the R port 55c of the manual valve 55, is outputted by the output port 62a only when the select actuator 53 transmits a switching actuation to the third switching mechanism 43 to switch to the reverse gear stage. A shift position detection valve 64 is provided adjacent to the shift actuator 52, and the former has a spool valve shaft 64s which is coupled to the piston 52p and provided slidably in an axial direction. The shift position detection valve 64 is provided with an input port 64c which communicates with the output port 62a of the select position detection valve 62, an output port 64d which supplies the actuating oil to the input clutch 17, an input port 64a to which the line pressure is inputted when such the failure that the solenoid valves SOL1 to SOL8 cannot be energized occurs, and an output port 64b which supplies the line pressure to the select actuator 53 when the failure occurs. The spool valve shaft 64s causes the input port 64a and the output port 64b to communicate only when the piston 52p of the shift actuator 52 is held in the intermediate position of FIG. 5, and causes the input port 64c and the output port 64d to communicate at the other positions. In other words, when the switching mechanisms 41 to 43 are positioned at the neutral position thereof, the input port 64a and the output port 64b are caused to communicate, and also, when the transmission gear train is selected by the switching mechanisms 41 to 43, the input port 64c and the output port 64d are caused to communicate. Between the line pressure supply section 57 and the solenoid valves SOL1 to SOL4 for controlling the shift actuator 52 and the select actuator 53, a fail safe valve 68, which controls the supply of the line pressure during the normal operation and when the failure occurs, is provided. The fail safe valve 68 has a spool valve shaft 68s which is actuated by a pilot pressure and a spring force, and further has input ports 68a, 68f which are connected with the line pressure oil passage 56, an output port 68b which supplies the line pressure when the failure occurs, an output port 68e which supplies the line pressure during the normal operation; and discharge ports 68c, 68d, 68g which discharge the actuating oil. A pilot chamber 68p provided in the fail safe valve 68 is connected with a pilot pressure oil passage 70, which communicates with a pilot pressure supply section 69, the normally closed solenoid valve SOL5 being provided in the pilot pressure oil passage 70. Upon energization of the solenoid valve SOL5, the pilot pressure is supplied to the pilot chamber 68p, and then since the spool valve shaft 68s is moved in a direction opposing the spring, the output port 68b and the discharge port 68c communicate each other, and also the output port 68e and the input port 68f communicate each other. On the other hand, when energization of the solenoid valve SOL5 is cut off, the spool valve shaft 68s is actuated by the spring, so that the input port 68a and the output port 68b communicate each other, and also the output port 68e and the discharge port 68d communicate each other. An actuating oil passage 71 for guiding the actuating oil to the shift actuator 52 and the select actuator 53 is connected to the output port 68e of the fail safe valve 68. The actuating oil is supplied via a shuttle valve 72a to the solenoid valves SOL3, SOL4 which control the actuation of the select actuator 53, and also the actuating oil is supplied via a shuttle valve 72b to the solenoid valves SOL1, SOL2 which control the actuation of the shift actuator 52. A forcible reverse shift valve 73, which controls the switching action for the reverse gear stage by the shift actuator 52, is provided between the shuttle valve 72b and the solenoid valve SOL2. The forcible reverse shift valve 73 has a spool valve shaft 73s which is actuated by the pilot pressure and the spring force, an input port 73a to which the actuating oil is inputted from the shuttle valve 72b, and an output port 73b which supplies the actuating oil toward the solenoid valve SOL2. When the pilot pressure is supplied, the spool valve shaft 73s is moved in a direction opposing the spring, so that the input port 73a and the output port 73b are both shut off. On the other hand, when the pilot pressure is shut off, the spool valve shaft 73s is actuated by the spring, so that the input port 73a and the output port 73b communicate each other. A pilot chamber 73p which is provided in this forcible reverse shift valve 73 is in communication with the output port 62a of the select position detection valve 62, and also, when the select actuator 53 is moved to a reverse position in the rightward direction of FIG. 5, the pilot pressure is inputted to the pilot chamber 73p, so that the input port 73a and the output port 73b are shut off. As shown in FIG. 4, a normally open solenoid valve SOL6 is provided at an actuating oil passage 65a which guides the actuating oil to the input clutch 17. An actuating oil passage 65b is connected between the actuating oil passage 65a and an actuating oil passage 65 which guides the actuating oil from the output port 64d of the shift position detection valve 64, where shuttle valves 72c, 72d are provided at each connection port. In addition, an input clutch pressure change-over valve 74, which controls the supply of the actuating oil to the actuating oil passage 65a when the failure occurs, is provided between the actuating oil passage 65a and the D port 55b of the manual valve 55. The input clutch pressure change-over valve 74 has a spool valve shaft 74s which is actuated by the pilot pressure and the spring force, and further is provided with an output port 74a which supplies the actuating oil to the input clutch 17 via the shuttle valve 72c, an input port 74b which communicates with the D port oil passage 58, an input port 74c which inputs the actuating oil of the input clutch 17 when the failure occurs, and an output port 74d which supplies the actuating oil to the input clutch 17 when the failure occurs. When the pilot pressure is supplied to the input clutch pressure change-over valve 74, the spool valve shaft 74s slides in the direction opposing the spring so that the input port 74c and the output port 74d communicate each other. On the other hand, when the pilot pressure is shut off and the actuating oil of a pilot chamber 74p is discharged, the spool valve shaft 74s slides by the spring, and the input port 74b and the output port 74a communicate each other. A normally closed solenoid valve SOL7 is provided between the first bypass clutch 31 and the D port oil passage 58. A shuttle valve 72e is provided at an actuating oil passage 76 which connects the first bypass clutch 31 with the solenoid valve SOL7, and through the energization of the solenoid valve SOL7, the line pressure supplied from the D port 55b of the manual valve 55 is supplied to the first bypass clutch 31 via the actuating oil passage 76. In addition, the normally closed solenoid valve SOL8 is provided between the second bypass clutch 32 and the D port oil passage 58. A shuttle valve 72f is provided in an actuating oil passage 77 connecting the second bypass clutch 32 with the solenoid valve SOL8, and also a fail safe bypass valve 78 for controlling the supply of the actuating oil of the bypass clutches 31, 32 is provided between the shuttle valve 72f and the second bypass clutch 32. The fail safe bypass valve 78 has a spool valve shaft 78s which is actuated by the pilot pressure and the actuating oil line pressure, and further is provided with discharge ports 78a, 78d which discharge the actuating oil, an output port 78b which supplies the actuating oil to the second bypass clutch 32, an input port 78c connected with the actuating oil passage 77, a control port 78e connected with an actuating oil passage 77b branching from the actuating oil passage 77, and a control port 78f which is connected with a control oil passage 76a branching from the actuating oil passage 76 being connected with the first bypass clutch 31. Further, the line pressure oil passage 56 is connected with a pilot chamber 78p which is provided in the fail safe bypass valve 78. The spool valve shaft 78s of the fail safe bypass valve 78 has valve bodies 79a, 79b of a first pressure-receiving surface area A.sub.1, a valve body 79c of a second pressure-receiving surface area A.sub.2 which is setted to be between A.sub.1 and 2.multidot.A.sub.1, and a valve body 79d of a third pressure-receiving surface area A.sub.3 which is setted to be between A.sub.1 and A.sub.2. For example, when the D port 55b of the manual valve 55 opens, the solenoid valve SOL7 is energized, and the actuating oil is being supplied to the first bypass clutch 31, the line pressure is applied from the line pressure oil passage 56 to the valve body 79a, and then the line pressure is applied from the control oil passage 76a to the valve body 79d. Thus, a thrust of A.sub.1.multidot.P.sub.L in addition to a spring-biasing force acts on the spool valve shaft 78s in a rightward direction of FIG. 4, and a thrust (A.sub.1 -A.sub.3)P.sub.L acts in a leftward direction thereon, and consequently, the spool valve shaft 78s is driven rightwards, so that the input port 78c and the output port 78b communicate each other. Here, P.sub.L is the line pressure. Also, when the solenoid valve SOL8 is energized, and the actuating oil is supplied to the second bypass clutch 32, the line pressure from the line pressure oil passage 56 acts on the valve body 79a, the line pressure from the actuating oil passage 77 acts on the valve bodies 79a, 79b, and the line pressure from the control oil passage 77b acts on the valve bodies 79c, 79d. Therefore, the thrust of 3A.sub.1.multidot.P.sub.L acts rightwards on the spool valve shaft 78s, and the thrust of (A.sub.1 +A.sub.2)P.sub.L acts leftwards thereon, and, consequently, the spool valve shaft 78s is driven rightwards. Furthermore, when the two solenoid valves SOL8, SOL7 are energized, the line pressure is applied to the valve body 79d by the control oil passage 76a in addition to the state where the solenoid valve SOL8 alone is energized. In such a situation, the thrust of 3A.sub.1.multidot.P.sub.L acts rightwards on the spool valve shaft 78s, and the thrust of (A.sub.1 +A.sub.2 +A.sub.3)P.sub.L acts leftwards thereon, and consequently, the spool valve shaft 78s is driven leftwards, so that the input port 78c and the output port 78b are shut off, and the output port 78b and the discharge port 78a communicate each other. Thus, as a result of providing the fail safe bypass valve 78, the actuating oil is not supplied simultaneously to the two bypass clutches 31, 32, but the first bypass clutch 31 becomes priority. As shown in FIG. 3, the energization and shut-off (ON, OFF) of the solenoid valves SOL1 to SOL8 described above are controlled by a control device (ECU) 100. Signals from an inhibitor switch 101, an engine speed sensor 102, a brake switch 103 are inputted to the control device 100. The control device 100 detects the position of the select lever on the basis of a signal from the inhibitor switch 101, the engine speed through a signal from the engine speed sensor 102, a brake operation through the signal from the brake switch 103, and the current vehicle speed and accelerator opening degree through signals from additional sensors. Further, the control device 100 controls the ON and OFF of each of the solenoid valves SOL1 to SOL8 in accordance with drive states of the vehicle and the engine and the range position set by the select lever, based on the detected data, and thus gear-shifting of the automatic transmission. The following is a description for the operating state of each of the solenoid valves, when the electronic control system is working normally, that is, in a normal travel state. First, in the normal state, when the neutral range is selected using the select lever, that is, the manual valve 55 is set at a position N, the solenoid valve SOL5 is energized, and the line pressure from the line pressure supply section 57 is supplied to the solenoid valve SOL1 via the fail safe valve 68 and the shuttle valve 72b. The line pressure is also supplied to the solenoid valve SOL2 from the shuttle valve 72b via the forcible reverse shift valve 73. The line pressure supplied to the normally open solenoid valves SOL1, SOL2 is supplied to the oil chambers of the shift actuator 52, so that the shift actuator 52 is held in the neutral position thereof. Further, since the D port 55b of the manual valve 55 is shut off, the line pressure is not supplied to the input clutch 17 or the first and second bypass clutches 31, 32. Therefore, in the neutral range, the solenoid valve SOL5 alone is energized, and thus the input clutch 17 maintains an disengaged state without any transmission gear train being selected. In a normal state, when the drive range is selected using the select lever such that the manual valve 55 is set at the position D, the manual valve 55 is actuated so that the line pressure port 55a and the D port 55b communicate, and consequently, the line pressure is supplied to the input clutch 17 from the D port 55b via the input clutch pressure change-over valve 74, the shuttle valve 72c, and the normally open solenoid valve SOL6. Also, since the line pressure from the D port 55b is supplied to the normally closed solenoid valves SOL7, SOL8 which control the bypass clutches 31, 32 respectively, when the solenoid valve SOL7 is energized, the first bypass clutch 31 is engaged, and also when the solenoid valve SOL8 is energized, the second bypass clutch 32 is engaged. Furthermore, similarly to the neutral range, the line pressure is supplied up to the solenoid valves SOL1 to SOL4, and it is possible to actuate the first and second switching mechanisms 41, 42 by controlling the energization of the solenoid valves SOL1 to SOL4. Therefore, in the drive range, when the solenoid valve SOL5 is energized, and the energization of the solenoid valves SOL1 to SOL4, SOL7, SOL8 is controlled, it is possible to set the transmission gear train to any one of the first to sixth speeds. The engaging or disengaging of the input clutch 17 can be controlled by controlling the energization of the solenoid valve SOL6. Further, in the normal state, when the reverse range is selected using the select lever so that the manual valve 55 is setted at the position R, the line pressure port 55a and the R port 55c communicate each other, and also the D port 55b is shut off. Consequently, in the drive range, the line pressure, which is supplied to the input clutch 17 and the bypass clutches 31, 32 by the D port 55b, is shut off. In order to perform switching to the reverse gear stage from this stage, the energization of the solenoid valves SOL1, SOL2 is shut off, and the shift actuator 52 is moved to the neutral position. Also, by shutting off the energization of the solenoid valves SOL3, SOL4, the select actuator 53 is moved to the reverse position to select the third switching mechanism 43. Upon actuation of the select actuator 53, the select position detection valve 62 is actuated simultaneously working together therewith, so that the line pressure outputted from the R port 55c is inputted into the pilot chamber 73p of the forcible reverse shift valve 73 via the select position detection valve 62, and then the line pressure supplied to the solenoid valve SOL2 is shut off. When the line pressure of the solenoid valve SOL2 is shut off, the shift actuator 52 causes the third switching mechanism 43 to be actuated from the neutral position to the reverse position for switching to the reverse gear stage. Thus, when the transmission gear train is set at the reverse gear stage through the sequential actuation of the select actuator 53 and the shift actuator 52. The line pressure outputted from the select position detection valve 62 is guided to the actuating oil passage 65 due to the shift position detection valve 64 which is actuated simultaneously working together with the shift actuator 52, and thus supplied to the input clutch 17. In other words, after the switching to the transmission gear train of the reverse gear stage is completed, the input clutch 17 is engaged, and thus the drive power is transmitted to the input shaft 11. Therefore, it is possible to perform the gear shift operation smoothly and reliably. Hereinafter, explained will be the travel control under the situation where the solenoid valves SOL1 to SOL8 can no longer be energized because of an occurrence of the electrical system failure, that is, when the failure occurs. As shown in FIGS. 4 and 5, a fail mode valve 80, which controls the switching of the line pressure supplied to the shift actuator 52 when the failure occurs, is provided between the line pressure supply section 57 and the solenoid valves SOL1, SOL2. The fail mode valve 80 has a spool valve shaft 80s which is actuated by the pilot pressure and the spring force, and also an actuating oil passage 71 is connected to a pilot chamber 80p and communicates with the output port 68e of the fail safe valve 68. Further, the fail mode valve 80 is provided with discharge ports 80a, 80f, 80h for discharging the actuating oil, an input port 80d to which the line pressure is inputted through the line pressure oil passage 56, an output port 80e which is connected with the actuating oil passage 82 for guiding the line pressure toward the shift actuator 52 when the failure occurs, and an input port 80g which inputs the oil pressure for actuating the spool valve shaft 80s. The spool valve shaft 80s of the fail mode valve 80 has valve bodies 81a, 81e of a pressure-receiving surface area A.sub.4, and valve bodies 81b to 81d of a larger pressure-receiving surface area A.sub.5 than A.sub.4. Therefore, in the normal travel drive range in which the pilot pressure is supplied into the pilot chamber 80p at any time due to the energization of the SOL5, a thrust of A.sub.5.multidot.P.sub.L acts in a rightward direction of FIG. 4 on the spool valve shaft 80s, and a thrust of kl acts in a leftward direction thereon. In a normal travel reverse range, in addition to the state in the drive range, the line pressure is inputted from the R port 55c to the input port 80g, and thus a thrust of A.sub.4.multidot.P.sub.L acts in a rightward direction on the spool valve shaft 80s, and a thrust of kl acts in the leftward direction thereon. Here, k is a spring constant, l is a spring displacement amount, and P.sub.L is the line pressure. Since the spring constant is setted to be smaller than (A.sub.5 -A.sub.4)P.sub.L /l, the spool valve shaft 80s is moved rightwards in a normal state. In the drive range, a thrust of (A.sub.5 -A.sub.4)P.sub.L acts in a rightward direction of FIG. 4 on the spool valve shaft 80s when the failure occurs, and a thrust of kl acts in a leftward direction thereon, and thus the spool valve shaft 80s is held rightwards. Further, since the line pressure is inputted to the input port 80g upon setting at the reverse range, the thrust acting on the spool valve shaft 80s is only the leftward thrust kl, and thus the spool valve shaft 80s slides leftwards. Therefore, only in the reverse range during the failure, the spool valve shaft 80s of the fail mode valve 80 slides leftwards, the input port 80d and the output port 80e communicate each other, and in the different circumstances, the spool valve shaft 80s slides rightwards so that the input port 80d and the output port 80e are both shut off. When the transmission gear train is set at any one of the first speed, the second speed, the fourth speed, and the fifth speed, the normally closed solenoid valve SOL5 is turned OFF, and the line pressure of the shift actuator 52 is shut off as a result of the actuation of the fail safe valve 68 in a case where an electrical system failure occurs. However, in the situation, the transmission gear train is maintained during the vehicle travel due to a resistance in meshing with the synchronizer sleeves 41b, 42b and the splines 21c, 22c, 24c, 25c, respectively, and also by using a detent mechanism, so that the vehicle can travel forwards. Also, upon selecting the neutral range by using the select lever, the D port oil passage 58 is closed, and thus the supply of the oil pressure to the input clutch 17 is suspended. Furthermore, when the transmission gear train is in a reverse gear stage, in the event of a fail state, the spool valve shafts 68s, 80s of the fail safe valve 68 and the fail mode valve 80, respectively, slide in a leftward direction of FIG. 4. During a normal travel, although the line pressure supplied from the output port 68e is shut off, the input port 80d and the output port 80e of the fail mode valve 80 communicate each other, and the line pressure is supplied to the shift actuator 52 via the actuating oil passage 82. At this time, the input port 73a and the output port 73b of the forcible reverse shift valve 73 are shut off. Consequently, the line pressure is supplied only to the normally open solenoid valve SOL1, and thus the shift actuator 52 can maintain the reverse position. Therefore, the vehicle is capable of travelling in the reverse range, and upon selecting the neutral range by using the select lever, the R port oil passage 59 is closed, so that the supply of the oil pressure to the input clutch 17 is suspended. On the other hand, the transmission gear trains of the third gear and the sixth gear are set by either of the two bypass clutches 31, 32. The two bypass clutches 31, 32 are controlled by the normally closed solenoid valves SOL7, SOL8 respectively, meaning that, during failure, the line pressure of the bypass clutches 31, 32 is discharged, and thus it is no longer possible to maintain the third speed or the sixth speed transmission gear train. Therefore, as shown in FIGS. 4 and 5, an oil pressure shutoff valve 83 for controlling the supply of the line pressure to the shift position detection valve 64 is provided between the fail safe valve 68 and the shift position detection valve 64. Further, a reverse bypass change-over valve 84 for controlling the supply of the line pressure to the input clutch 17, the two bypass clutches 31, 32, or the select actuator 53, and also a bypass oil passage change-over valve 85 for controlling the supply of the line pressure from the reverse bypass change-over valve 84 to the two shuttle valves 72e, 72f are provided between the shift position detection valve 64 and the two bypass clutches 31, 32. Provided in the oil pressure shutoff valve 83 are discharge ports 83a, 83d for discharging the actuating oil, an input port 83c, for communicating with the output port 68b of the fail safe valve 68, and an output port 83b for communicating with the input port 64a of the shift position detection valve 64. Further, the oil pressure shutoff valve 83 has a spool valve shaft 83s which is actuated by a pilot pressure and the spring force. When the pilot pressure is supplied thereto, the spool valve shaft 83s is moved in a rightward direction in FIG. 5 so that the input port 83c and the output port 83b communicate. On the other hand, when the pilot pressure is shut off therefrom, the spool valve shaft 83s is moved leftwards by the spring force so that the input port 83c and the output port 83b are shut off. A pilot chamber 83p of the oil pressure shutoff valve 83 communicates with the D port oil passage 58 and the R port oil passage 59 via the shuttle valve 72g, and consequently, excepting the neutral range, the pilot pressure is supplied at any time. Therefore, when the failure occurs, upon selecting the drive range or the reverse range, the pilot pressure is supplied to the pilot chamber 83p, and the line pressure is outputted from the output port 68b of the fail safe valve 68, so that the line pressure can be guided to the input port 64a of the shift position detection valve 64. Further, provided in the reverse bypass change-over valve 84 are a discharge port 84d for discharging the actuating oil, an input port 84b for communicating with the output port 64b of the shift position detection valve 64, an output port 84a for supplying the line pressure to the input port 74c of the input clutch pressure change-over valve 74 and to the bypass oil passage change-over valve 85, and an output port 84c for supplying the line pressure to the select actuator 53. Further, the reverse bypass change-over valve 84 has a spool valve shaft 84s which is actuated by the pilot pressure and the spring force. When the pilot pressure is supplied thereto, the spool valve shaft 84s is actuated in the rightward direction of FIG. 5 so that the input port 84b and the output port 84c communicate each other. On the other hand, when the pilot pressure is shut off therefrom, the spool valve shaft 84s is actuated leftwards so that the input port 84b and the output port 84a communicate. A pilot chamber 84p of the reverse bypass change-over valve 84 communicates with the R port oil passage 59, and thus in the reverse range, the pilot pressure is supplied at any time, and also, when the reverse range is canceled, the supply of the pilot pressure is canceled. Therefore, when the actuation to the reverse range is performed and the line pressure is outputted from the output port 64b of the shift position detection valve 64, it is possible to supply the line pressure toward the select actuator 53. Also, when operation to the neutral or the drive range is performed and the line pressure is outputted from the output port 64b, the line pressure can be supplied toward the input clutch 17 and the two bypass clutches 31, 32. Provided in the bypass oil passage change-over valve 85 are discharge ports 85b, 85f, 85h for discharging the actuating oil, an input port 85a for communicating with the actuating oil passage 77, an input port 85i for communicating with the actuating oil passage 76, and an input port 85d for communicating with the output port 84a of the reverse bypass change-over valve 84. Further, provided in the bypass oil passage change-over valve 85 are an output port 85c for supplying the line pressure to the first bypass clutch 31 via the shuttle valve 72e, an output port 85e for supplying the line pressure to the second bypass clutch 32 via the shuttle valve 72f, and an input port 85g for supplying the line pressure from the output port 80c of the fail mode valve 80. In addition, the bypass oil passage change-over valve 85 has a spool valve shaft 85s which is actuated by the line oil pressure and the spring force. When the line pressure is supplied to the input port 85a, the spool valve shaft 85s is actuated in a rightward direction of FIG. 4, and also when the line pressure is supplied to the input port 85i, the spool valve shaft 85s is actuated leftwards. Therefore, during the normal travel, upon setting at the third speed range, the spool valve shaft 85s of the bypass oil passage change-over valve 85 is actuated leftwards, so that the input port 85d and the output port 85c can communicate, and, upon setting at the sixth speed range, the spool valve shaft 85s is actuated rightwards, so that the input port 85d and the output port 85e can communicate each other. Moreover, the input port 85g is provided to apply a thrust in the rightward direction onto a valve body 85j when the spool valve shaft 85s is actuated rightwards due to applying the line pressure onto the input port 85a. In other words, even if the line pressure of the input port 85a is shut off, the spool valve shaft 85s can be held rightwards with opposing against the spring force through the provision of the input port 85g. Under such a hydraulic circuit, when the fail state occurs during the travel with the transmission gear train setted at third speed range, the energization of the normally closed solenoid valves SOL5, SOL7 is shut off, and thus the supply of line pressure of the first bypass clutch 31 is also shut off. As a result, the spool valve shaft 68s of the fail safe valve 68 is actuated leftwards. Next, the movement direction of each of the spool valve shafts 64s, 83s to 85s at this time will be explained referring to FIGS. 4 and 5. The oil pressure shutoff valve 83 is actuated rightwards, and the shift position detection valve 64 is actuated at the neutral position, since the pilot pressure is supplied by the D port oil passage 58. The reverse bypass change-over valve 84 is actuated leftwards since a pilot pressure is shut off as a result of shutting off the R port oil passage 59. Further, the bypass oil passage change-over valve 85 is actuated leftwards due to the first bypass clutch 31 being engaged, respectively. Therefore, after the failure occurred, the line pressure is sequentially guided from the line pressure supply section 57 through the input port 68a of the fail safe valve 68, the output port 68b thereof, the input port 83c of the oil pressure shutoff valve 83, the output port 83b thereof, the input port 64a of the shift position detection valve 64, the output port 64b thereof, the input port 84b of the reverse bypass change-over valve 84, the output port 84a thereof, the input port 85d of the bypass oil passage change-over valve 85, the output port 85c thereof, and then to the shuttle valve 72e. Lastly, the line pressure is thus supplied to the first bypass clutch 31, thereby allowing the travel in the third speed range. On the other hand, when the fail state occurs during the travel set at the sixth speed, the line pressure is supplied up to the bypass oil passage change-over valve 85, similarly to the situation of the third speed range as mentioned above. However, the spool valve shaft 85s is actuated rightwards here since it is engaged with the second bypass clutch 32. Therefore, the line pressure supplied to the input port 85d can be supplied to the second bypass clutch 32 via the output port 85e, the shuttle valve 72f, and the fail safe bypass valve 78, thereby allowing the travel in the sixth speed range. When the neutral range is selected by using the select lever under this state, the D port oil passage 58 is closed, and thus the supply of the oil pressure to the input clutch 17 is suspended. When it is assumed that the fail state occurs during forward or reverse travel under such a hydraulic control circuit, the setted transmission gear train can be maintained in spite of the fail state. Upon operating the select lever to the neutral range under the situation, the input clutch 17 is disengaged, so that the drive power of the input shaft 11 can be shut off. Hereinafter, explained will be the forward travel and reverse travel following the failure, which are under the situation where the select lever is operated from the neutral range to the reverse range, and also from the reverse range to the drive range via the neutral range, respectively. FIG. 6 is a hydraulic circuit diagram showing line pressure transmission passages from the operational completion of the select lever to the reverse range until the select actuator 53 begins to be actuated to the reverse position, and also FIG. 7 is a hydraulic circuit diagram showing line pressure transmission passages from the state of FIG. 6 until the engagement of the input clutch 17. Some lines with dark colors of FIGS. 6 and 7 are line pressure transmission passages. Further, FIG. 8 is a schematic view showing line pressure transmission passages under the situation where the reverse range is selected during the normal operation and during the failure, respectively, where the transmission passages during the normal operation are shown by using solid lines, and transmission passages during the failure are shown by using broken lines. Further, the passages indicated by the arrows in FIG. 8 are the passages for supplying the line pressure which works as the pilot pressure. As for the state of the automatic transmission in the neutral range, as described heretofore, this is a state in which the transmission gear train during the failure is maintained and only the input clutch 17 is disengaged. When the vehicle stops, and the select lever is operated into the reverse range under this state, the manual valve 55 is actuated so that the line pressure port 55a and the R port 55c communicate, and then the line pressure is supplied to the R port oil passage 59. Also, as shown in FIG. 6, the spool valve shafts 83s, 84s of the oil pressure shutoff valve 83 and the reverse bypass change-over valve 84 which have the pilot chambers 83p, 84p that communicate with the R port oil passage 59, respectively, are both actuated in a rightward direction of FIG. 6. Further, as a result of the oil pressure being supplied to the R port oil passage 59, the line pressure is applied to the input port 80g of the fail mode valve 80, so that the spool valve shaft 80s is actuated leftwards. Furthermore, the line pressure is supplied up to the input port 62b of the select position detection valve 62 which communicates with the R port oil passage 59. Through the actuation of the oil pressure shutoff valve 83, the line pressure supplied via the fail safe valve 68 is supplied up to the input port 64a of the shift position detection valve 64 via the oil pressure shutoff valve 83. Then, since the fail mode valve 80 is actuated by the spring force, the line pressure of the line pressure oil passage 56 is supplied to the shift actuator 52 via the fail mode valve 80 and then the shuttle valve 72b. Here, the pilot pressure is not supplied from the select position detection valve 62 to the forcible reverse shift valve 73 which is provided upstream of the solenoid valve SOL2, thereby allowing the input port 73a and the output port 73b to communicate each other. Therefore, the line pressure supplied to the shift actuator 52 through the actuation of the fail safe valve 68 actuates the shift actuator 52 to the neutral position thereof via the normally open solenoid valves SOL1, SOL2. Further, due to the actuation of the fail mode valve 80, the pilot pressure is supplied to the input clutch pressure change-over valve 74 so that the spool valve shaft 74s is actuated in a rightward direction of FIG. 4. When the shift actuator 52 is actuated to the neutral position, the input port 64a and the output port 64b of the shift position detection valve 64 communicate each other, and consequently, the line pressure supplied via the oil pressure shutoff valve 83 is supplied to the input port 84b of the reverse bypass change-over valve 84 via the shift position detection valve 64. In this case, the input port 84b and the output port 84c of the reverse bypass change-over valve 84 communicate each other, and the line pressure is supplied to the select actuator 53 via the reverse bypass change-over valve 84 and the shuttle valve 72a. Here, since the solenoid valve SOL3 is normally open whereas the solenoid valve SOL4 is normally closed, the line pressure is supplied to port 53a alone via the solenoid valve SOL3. Thus, the select actuator 53 is actuated to the reverse position which transmits a switching action to the third switching mechanism 43. As shown in FIG. 7, when the select actuator 53 is actuated to the reverse position, the input port 62b and the output port 62a of the select position detection valve 62 communicate each other, and consequently, the line pressure supplied from the R port oil passage 59 is inputted to the pilot chamber 73p of the forcible reverse shift valve 73, thereby shutting off the communicated input port 73a and the output port 73b. Therefore, the line pressure of the shift actuator 52 is supplied only from the normally open solenoid valve SOL1, so that the shift actuator 52 is held in the neutral position is actuated to a reverse position, and thus the transmission gear train is set at the reverse gear stage. When the shift actuator 52 is actuated to the reverse position, the input port 64c and the output port 64d of the shift position detection valve 64 communicate, and therefore, the line pressure supplied from the select position detection valve 62 is supplied to the input clutch 17 via the two shuttle valves 72d, 72c and the normally open solenoid valve SOL6. Thus, even during the failure, the reverse travel is permitted by operating the select lever to the reverse range. Furthermore, even in the conditions where the control of the energization of the solenoid valves SOL1 to SOL4, SOL6 is not possible, the switching action of the select actuator 53 can be performed after the shift actuator 52 is setted at the neutral position, and then the input clutch 17 can be engaged after the switching action of the shift actuator 52 is completed, whereby it is possible to prevent gear clashes and also to reliably perform the switching action to the reverse gear stage. Next, explained will be action conditions at the time of performing an operation from the reverse range to the drive range via the neutral range. When the select lever is operated to the neutral range, the manual valve 55 is actuated so that the R port 55c communicating with the line pressure port 55a is shut off. The pilot pressure of the forcible reverse shift valve 73, which is supplied from the R port oil passage 59 via the select position detection valve 62, is shut off, and thus, the spool valve shaft 73s is actuated leftwards. Furthermore, the supply of the line pressure of the input clutch 17 supplied via the shift position detection valve 64 is also shut off, and then the input clutch 17 enters a release state. Further, since the pilot pressure of the oil pressure shutoff valve 83 and the reverse bypass change-over valve 84 is also shut off, the spool valve shafts 83s, 84s are both actuated leftwards. Then, through the actuation of the forcible reverse shift valve 73, the line pressure of the normally open solenoid valve SOL2 shut off for the moment is supplied, so that the shift actuator 52 is actuated to the neutral position. When the select lever is actuated to the drive range, the manual valve 55 is actuated so that the line pressure port 55a and the D port 55b communicate, and then the line pressure is supplied to the D port oil passage 58. The spool valve shaft, of the oil pressure shutoff valve 83 having a pilot chamber 83p which communicates via the shuttle valve 72g with the D port oil passage 58, is thus actuated rightwards. As a result of the actuation of the oil pressure shutoff valve 83, the line pressure supplied to the oil pressure shutoff valve 83 via the fail safe valve 68 is supplied to the reverse bypass change-over valve 84 via the shift position detection valve 64 due to the neutral position action of shift actuator 52. In this case, the pilot pressure is not supplied to the reverse bypass change-over valve 84, and the line pressure is supplied, via the output port 84a, to the input port 85d of the bypass oil passage change-over valve 85, and to the input port 74c of the input clutch pressure change-over valve 74, respectively. The pilot pressure is not supplied to the bypass oil passage change-over valve 85, and the line pressure of the input port 85d is supplied from the output port 85c to the first bypass clutch 31 via the shuttle valve 72e. On the other hand, since the pilot pressure is inputted from the output port 80e of the fail mode valve 80 to the input clutch pressure change-over valve 74, the line pressure of the input port 74c is supplied to the input clutch 17 via the output port 74d, the shuttle valves 72d, 72c, and the normally open solenoid valve SOL6. Thus, during the failure, upon operating the select lever from the reverse range to the drive range via the neutral range, a limp home control is performed, so that the travel using the third speed range becomes possible irrespective of the state of the transmission gear train selected prior to the failure. Taken together, the operations of the hydraulic control apparatus when the reverse range is selected during the failure, are as follows. First, when the shift actuator 52 is actuated to the neutral position for releasing the switching mechanisms 41 to 43, the actuating oil is supplied toward the select actuator 53 from the shift position detection valve 64 for switching the oil passage by simultaneously working together with the shift actuator 52. The normally open solenoid valve SOL3 and the normally closed solenoid valve SOL4 are provided respectively in the two actuating oil passages 61a, 61b which actuate the select actuator 53, and also the actuating oil is supplied to the select actuator 53 via the normally open solenoid valve SOL3 alone. Upon the actuation of the select actuator 53 to the reverse position for selecting the third switching mechanism 43, the actuating oil is supplied to the pilot chamber 73p of the forcible reverse shift valve 73 from the select position detection valve 62 which opens/closes the oil passage under the working together with the select actuator 53. The spool valve shaft 73s of the forcible reverse shift valve 73 is actuated so that the actuating oil supplied to the port 52b of the shift actuator 52 is shut off, and consequently, the actuating oil is then supplied to one oil chamber alone via the port 52a of the shift actuator 52, thereby allowing the shift actuator 52 to actuate the third switching mechanism 43 and to set the transmission gear train to the reverse gear stage. When actuating the shift actuator 52 to the reverse position that sets the reverse gear stage, the shift position detection valve 64 switches the oil passage, so that the actuating oil outputted from the select position detection valve 62 is supplied to the input clutch 17, the input clutch 17 is engaged, and thus the vehicle travels in reverse. Thus, in a state where all the switching mechanisms 41 to 43 are released, the select actuator 53 is actuated, and after the third switching mechanism 43 is actuated and completes a switching action to the reverse gear stage, it is possible to engage the input clutch 17, and consequently, the travel is permitted by the reliable switching to the reverse gear stage without gear clashes or interlocking. The present invention is not limited by the aforementioned embodiment, a variety of modifications being possible within the scope of the present invention without departing from the spirit thereof. For example, the two bypass clutches 31, 32 have been provided on the input shaft 11 and the output shaft 12, respectively, but the two bypass clutches 31, 32 may also be provided on the input shaft 11, or similarly on the output shaft 12. As for the transmission gear train switching mechanisms 41 to 43, a synchromesh mechanism has been employed, but a dog clutch switching mechanism may also be employed. In the embodiment shown in the drawings, there are setted six forward travel stages, but the gear shift stages can be an arbitrary number of stages. Moreover, the third speed range is setted by the first bypass clutch, and the sixth speed range is setted by the second bypass clutch, but the setting of these transmission gear trains are not limited to such a way. Although the automatic transmission shown in the drawings has been applied to a four-wheel drive vehicle, the present invention can also be applied to FF vehicles and FR vehicles. The automatic transmission may be disposed in a longitudinal direction or a horizontal direction in the engine room. Moreover, the embodiment of the present invention have a structure to comprise two bypass clutches 31, 32, but a structure having one bypass clutch is also possible. In such a case, the structure may be formed such that the bypass oil passage change-over valve 85 and the fail safe bypass valve 78 are omitted, and the oil passage is connected from the reverse bypass change-over valve 84 to the bypass clutch via the shuttle valve. According to the present invention, it is possible to actuate the select actuator to the reverse position after the shift actuator is actuated to the neutral position, and then to engage the input clutch after the shift actuator is actuated to the reverse position, and thus it is possible to reliably perform switching to the transmission gear train for the backward travel without the gear clashes or interlocking. In addition, according to the present invention, even in a case where the solenoid valve for switching the transmission gear train is no longer operating due to an electrical system failure, it is possible to actuate the select actuator to the reverse position after the shift actuator is actuated to the neutral position, and to engage the input clutch after the shift actuator is actuated to a reverse position by performing a manual operation. Therefore, it is possible to reliably perform switching to a transmission gear train for the backward travel without the gear clashes or interlocking. While the presently preferred embodiment of the present invention has been shown and described, it is to be understood that these disclosures are for the purpose of illustration and that various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims. * * * * *",

Description BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a power transmission apparatus for a four-wheel drive vehicle, which distributes a driving force output from a transmission coupled to a transverse layout front engine to front and rear wheels. There is known a four-wheel drive vehicle in which a distribution of a driving force to the rear wheels is controlled by an electromagnetic clutch. In the four-wheel drive vehicle of a type in which the engine is transversely laid out, it is a common practice that the electromagnetic clutch is disposed on a rear drive pinion shaft located in the rear part of the vehicle body, as disclosed in a Japanese Utility Model Unexamined Publication No. Hei. 7-14229. In the case where the electromagnetic clutch is disposed in the rear part of the vehicle body, there is the possibility of increasing the size of harness components, and hence making the structure complicated. The electromagnetic clutch control unit is preferably disposed while being coupled to or in proximity to the engine control unit, the transmission control unit and the like in the vicinity of the engine, transmission and the like (in the front part of the vehicle body). In a case where the electromagnetic clutch control unit is disposed in the front part of the vehicle body, long harness components are required for connecting the electromagnetic clutch to the control unit. This leads to complexity of the structure for protecting the harness components. The electromagnetic clutch may be disposed in the front part of the vehicle body by disposing the electromagnetic clutch on the axis of the drive shaft of the front wheels or the axis of the pinion shaft of the direction-changing gear. Where the electromagnetic clutch is disposed on the axis of the front wheel drive shaft, the differential device must be installed at limited places within the transfer. In some types of schematic structure of the vehicle body, the transfer is enlarged in the axle direction, and hence, sometimes the on-board property is deteriorated. Where the electromagnetic clutch is disposed on the axis of the pinion shaft of the direction-changing gear, the transfer is enlarged to the front and rear directions. In such a case, the electromagnetic clutch of a large diameter overlaps with the steering gear box, a vehicle body schematic structure (cross member and others) and the like above or below those components. If the position of the steering gear box is shifted to another or the cross member is bent in order to secure a good positional relationship of those components with the electromagnetic clutch, there is a chance that the vehicle body structure is complicated, and the number of vehicle models is increased, and other disadvantages occur. The fact that the electromagnetic clutch of the large diameter overlaps with the steering gear box, the cross member and the like above or below those components, sometimes results in reduction of the cabin space and the minimum ground clearance. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a power transmission apparatus for use with a four-wheel drive vehicle, which is compact in construction, and excellent in on-board property. To achieve the above object, there is provided a power transmission apparatus for a four-wheel drive vehicle, according to the present invention comprising: a transfer disposed on a rear side of a transverse layout front engine, through which a driving force output from a transmission coupled with the transverse layout front engine is distributed to front and rear wheels, the transfer comprising: a pair of direction-changing gears for changing a transmission direction of the driving force; a first gear provided and rotated about an axis extending in a transmission direction that has been changed by the direction-changing gears; a second gear meshed with the first gear and rotated around an axis in parallel with the transmission direction that has been changed by the direction-changing gears, the second gear having a through hole at a center thereof; an output shaft, rotatably inserted through the through hole of the second gear, for transmitting the driving force to a propeller shaft; and an electromagnetic clutch disposed on the axis of the second gear and at a position closer to the engine than the second gear and on the center axis of the second gear, the electromagnetic clutch operable to control a transmission torque of the driving force between of a gear shaft portion of the second gear and the output shaft. In the power transmission apparatus for use with a four-wheel drive vehicle, an electromagnetic clutch container for containing the electromagnetic clutch may be independently provided within a transfer case of the transfer, and the electromagnetic clutch container is liquid-tightly separated from another container for containing another member in a manner that oil seals are brought into sliding contact with the outer periphery of the gear shaft portion that is extended into the electromagnetic clutch container. In addition, the above-mentioned object can also be achieved by a power transmission apparatus for a four-wheel drive vehicle, according to the present invention, comprising: a transfer disposed on a rear side of a transverse layout front engine, through which a driving force output from a transmission coupled with the transverse layout front engine is distributed to front and rear wheels, the transfer comprising: a pair of direction-changing gears for changing from a first transmission direction of the driving force to a second transmission direction of the driving force; a first gear provided and rotated about an axis extending in the second transmission direction; a second gear meshed with the first gear and rotated around an axis in parallel with the second transmission direction, the second gear having a through hole at a center thereof; an output shaft, rotatably inserted through the through hole of the second gear, for transmitting the driving force to a propeller shaft; and an electromagnetic clutch disposed on the axis of the second gear and between the transverse layout front engine than the second gear, the electromagnetic clutch operable to control a transmission torque of the driving force between the second gear and the output shaft.

In FIG. 1, reference numeral 1 designates an engine 1 transversely laid out in a front engine room of a vehicle. A transmission 2 is jointed to the left end of the engine 1, and a transfer 3 is integrally coupled to the rear end of the transmission 2. A driving force output from the engine 1 is appropriately geared by the automatic transmission apparatus 2, and then is distributed to the front wheels and the rear wheels by means of the transfer 3. As shown, the transfer 3 is disposed on the rear side of the transmission 2, while being offset with respect to the engine 1. The transfer 3 will be described in detail. The transfer 3 includes a front differential unit 5, a gear mechanism 7 and an electromagnetic clutch 8. The front differential unit 5 transmits the driving force from the transmission 2 to the front wheel side. The gear mechanism 7 distributes the driving force, which has been transmitted to a differential case 6 of the front differential unit 5, to the rear wheel side. The electromagnetic clutch 8 continuously varies a distribution of the driving force to the rear side in accordance with a running state and road conditions. Those components are respectively contained in a differential container 10, a gear container 11 and an electromagnetic clutch container 12, which are provided in a transfer case 9. Further, those components form key components of the transfer. In the front differential unit 5, a final gear 17 is provided around the differential case 6. The final gear 17 is meshed with a drive gear 16, which is fastened to an output shaft 15 of the transmission 2. The front differential unit 5, which is a differential unit of a bevel gear type, includes a pair of differential pinions 21 and right and left side gears 22R and 22L. The pair of differential pinions 21 are rotatably supported on a pinion shaft 20 fastened to within the differential case 6. The right and left side gears 22R and 22L are meshed with the differential pinions 21. A driving force is transmitted from the differential case 6 to the right and left side gear 22R and 22L, through the differential pinions 21. Those driving forces, respectively, are then transmitted to the right and left front wheels, through right and left drive shafts 25R and 25L. Those drive shafts, respectively, are inserted into right and left cylindrical parts 26R and 26L and spline-coupled to the right and left side gears 22R and 22L. The right cylindrical part 26R within the differential case 6 is extended into the gear container 11. The driving force is transmitted to the gear mechanism 7, via the right cylindrical part 26R thus extended. An oil seal 27, which is held in a case of the transmission 2, is brought into sliding contact with a mid position of the outer peripheral surface of the right cylindrical part 26R. The liquid-tightness of the differential container 10 and the gear container 11 is secured with the oil seal 27. In a case where the front differential unit 5 and the gear mechanism 7 are made of a same kind of lubricant oil, the oil seal 27 may be omitted. As shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, the gear mechanism 7 includes a pair of direction-changing gears (first and second direction-changing gears) 30 and 31, each of which consists of a hypoid gear, and a pair of gears (first and second gears) 32 and 33, each of which consists of a helical gear. The direction-changing gear 30 is fastened to a hollowed transfer shaft 34, which is spline-fit to the outer peripheral surface of the right cylindrical part 26R. The second direction-changing gear 31 is meshed with the direction-changing gear 30. A pinion shaft 31a as a transmitting shaft is integrally formed on and along the center axis of the direction-changing gear 31. The first gear 32 is spline-coupled to the pinion shaft 31a. The second gear 33 is meshed with the gear 32 at the right side of the gear 32. A gear shaft 33a of the second gear 33 is formed into a hollow-shape, and an output shaft 35 is slidably inserted into the hollow-shaped gear shaft 33a. The output shaft 35 can be coupled or de-coupled to the second gear 33 by a control of the electromagnetic clutch 8. When the electromagnetic clutch 8 is engaged, the driving force that have been transmitted to the second gear 33 is transmitted to the output shaft 35. The driving force is further transmitted to a rear differential device (not shown), through a propeller shaft 37 (see FIG. 4) that is spline-coupled to the output shaft 35. The electromagnetic clutch container 12, which contains the electromagnetic clutch 8, is disposed on the center axis of the output shaft 35 at a position that is located closer to the engine 1 than the second gear 33. As shown in FIG. 3, the gear shaft 33a and the output shaft 35 are extended into the electromagnetic clutch container 12. A pair of oil seals 36, which are held with the transfer case 9 and serve as sealing members, are brought into sliding contact with a mid position of the gear shaft 33a (FIG. 3). Those oil seals 36 are disposed side by side such that the sealing directions of them are opposed to each other. A liquid tightness between the gear container 11 and the electromagnetic clutch container 12 is secured with the oil seals 36. A clutch drum 40 is firmly fixed to the gear shaft 33a within the electromagnetic clutch container 12. A clutch hub 41 of the electromagnetic clutch 8 is integrally formed with the output shaft 35. The clutch drum 40 includes a first cylindrical part 40a and a second cylindrical part 40b. The first cylindrical part 40a is disposed in opposition to the clutch hub 41, and the second cylindrical part 40b is coupled to the front part of the first cylindrical part 40a. A main clutch 43 of a multiple disc type is disposed between the first cylindrical part 40a and the clutch hub 41. A rear wall member 45 that is spline-coupled to the first cylindrical part 40a is provided at the rear end of the main clutch 43. The rear wall member 45 is engaged and stopped to a snap ring 46, to thereby prevent it from being moved to the rear side of the main clutch 43. A thrust part 47 is disposed in front of the main clutch 43 is spline-coupled to the output shaft 35 on the front of the clutch hub 41. A cam ring 50 is disposed in front of the thrust part 47. A ball cam 51 is disposed between the thrust part 47 and the cam ring 50. A front wall member 52 is disposed in front of the cam ring 50, while being opposed to the latter. It is fastened to the second cylindrical part 40b by welding or other suitable means. The cam ring 50 is brought into contact with the front wall member 52, while a bearing 53 and a washer 54 intervening therebetween. With this, the forward movement of the cam ring 50 is restricted. A pilot clutch 55 of the multiple disc type is disposed between the second cylindrical part 40b and the cam ring 50. An armature 56, which is spline-coupled to the second cylindrical part 40b, is disposed on the rear part of the pilot clutch 55. The armature 56 is stopped at a snap ring 57, thereby restricting a backward movement of the pilot clutch 55. A ring-shaped magnet 60 is fastened to the transfer case 9 at a position that is closer to the front side than the front wall member 52. The end of the output shaft 35 is supported on the magnet 60 while a bearing 61 intervening therebetween. A ring 63 made of stainless steel is disposed on the front wall member 52. The ring 63 leads a magnetic flux developed by the magnet 60 to the armature 56, while preventing it from short-circuiting. An electromagnetic clutch control unit controls the engagement and/or disengagement of the electromagnetic clutch 8 by controlling the current feeding to the magnet 60. The electromagnetic clutch control unit, together with an engine control unit and a transmission control unit, is disposed in a space of the rear part of the engine 1. A lubricant oil used for the electromagnetic clutch container 12 is different in kind from a lubricant oil used for the differential container 10 and the gear container 11, and it lubricates the electromagnetic clutch 8 independently of the remaining ones. In the transfer 3, the driving force, which has been transmitted from the output shaft 15 of the transmission 2 through the final gear 17 to the differential case 6, is transmitted to the right and left front wheels, through the pinion shaft 20, the differential pinions 21, the right and left side gears 22R and 22L, and the right and left drive shafts 25R and 25L. The driving force transmitted to the differential case 6 is transmitted to the right cylindrical part 26R, and the driving force transmitted to the right cylindrical part 26R is then transmitted to the hollowed transfer shaft 34. The driving force transmitted to the hollowed transfer shaft 34 is changed in its direction by 90.degree. by the first and second direction-changing gears 30 and 31, and then is transmitted to the pinion shaft 31a. The driving force transmitted to the pinion shaft 31a is transmitted to the gear shaft 33a, after its direction is changed to the right and in parallel by the first and second gears 32 and 33. The driving force transmitted to the gear shaft 33a is transmitted to the output shaft 35 when the electromagnetic clutch 8 is engaged, and then to the rear wheels through the propeller shaft 37. The engaging of the electromagnetic clutch 8 is carried out such that the pilot clutch 55 is engaged by the attraction of the armature 56 by the magnet 60, the driving force acts on the ball cam 51 through the engaging of the pilot clutch 55, and the main clutch 43 is pressed by a thrust force of the thrust part 47. In the above-mentioned embodiment, the electromagnetic clutch 8 may be disposed in the front part of the vehicle body without increasing the size of the transfer 3 in such a manner that the center axis of the pinion shaft 31a for transmitting the driving force, the direction of which is changed by the first and second direction-changing gear 30 and 31, to the rear wheels, is displaced in parallel by the first and second gears 32 and 33, and the electromagnetic clutch 8 is disposed on the center axis of the second gear 33 in a space closer to the engine 1 than the second gear 33. Thus, the center axis of the pinion shaft 31a is displaced in parallel by the first and second gears 32 and 33, so that the electromagnetic clutch 8 may be disposed between the engine 1 and the gear mechanism 7. Therefore, there is no need of disposing the electromagnetic clutch 8 on the center axis of the right and left drive shafts 25R and 25L and the center axis of the pinion shaft 31a. As a result, the transfer 3 may be constructed to be compact and the on-board property is improved. In particular, there is no need of disposing the electromagnetic clutch 8 on the center axis of the pinion shaft 31a. With this feature, there is no chance that the electromagnetic clutch 8 overlaps with a gear box 70 transversely laid out in the front part of the vehicle, a cross member 71 and the like above or below those components (see FIG. 4). In this respect, the on-board property is improved. In other words, the electromagnetic clutch 8 may appropriately be positioned relative to the gear box 70 and the cross member 71 without changing the position of the gear box 70 or bending the cross member 71. Accordingly, it is easy to secure the collision safety with a simple vehicle body structure. Further, there is no need of disposing the electromagnetic clutch 8 across the gear box 70, the cross member 71, and the like. Therefore, the cabin space, the vehicle ground clearance and the like are satisfactorily secured. The laying out of the electromagnetic clutch 8 in the front part of the vehicle body is advantageous when the electromagnetic clutch control unit is laid out, the electromagnetic clutch control unit is connected with the electromagnetic clutch 8, and in other cases. By laying out the electromagnetic clutch 8 in the front part of the vehicle body, the electromagnetic clutch control unit may be disposed while being coupled to or in proximity to the engine control unit, the transmission control unit and the like, which are disposed in the front part of the vehicle body, without increasing the size of harness components for connecting the electromagnetic clutch 8 to the electromagnetic clutch control unit. Particularly, in this case, if the electromagnetic clutch control unit, the engine control unit, the transmission control unit and the like are coupled into a single unit, and the single unit is disposed in a space of the rear part of the engine 1, those individual units may effectively be protected without using special protecting members and the like. Further, the driving force is transmitted to the rear wheels through the pair of direction-changing gears 30 and 31, and further at least the pair of first and second gears 32 and 33. Setting of the gear ratio for the rear wheels is easy. Accordingly, it is easy to set the gear ratio between the front and rear wheels for a variety of vehicle assemblies which are different in engine and vehicle body dimensions. When the electromagnetic clutch 8 is disposed closer to the engine 1 than the second gear 33, it is easy to liquid-tightly construct the electromagnetic clutch container 12 independently of others. Specifically, when the electromagnetic clutch 8 is located closer to the engine 1 than the second gear 33, and the electromagnetic clutch 8 is coupled to one end of the gear shaft 33a and one end of the output shaft 35 passing through the gear shaft 33a, the seal required for the rotary section when forming the electromagnetic clutch container 12 is liquid-tightly formed, may be provided only on the periphery part of the gear shaft 33a. Further, if the lubricant oil whose characteristic is different from that of the lubricant oil for the remaining containers (differential container 10 and the gear container 11) in the transfer case 9, is used for the electromagnetic clutch container 12, the characteristic of the electromagnetic clutch 8 may be drawn out maximumly. Description has been made about the case where the center axis of the output shaft 35 is displaced to the right by the pair of gears 32 and 33. It is readily understood that the center axis of the output shaft 35 may be displaced and set at any position on the periphery of the shaft of the pinion shaft 31a. The center axis of the output shaft 35, as shown in FIG. 5, may be displaced to an upper position in accordance with a type of the vehicle body skeleton and a position of the steering gear box. The center axis of the output shaft 35 may also be displaced to a lower position, as shown in FIG. 6. As seen from the foregoing description, in the present invention, the center axis of a transmission shaft part whose direction is changed by a pair of direction-changing gears is displaced in parallel by a first gear provided on the transmission shaft part and a second gear in mesh with the first gear. An electromagnetic clutch, which couples to the second gear an output shaft for transmitting a driving force to a propeller shaft being rotatably inserted through the second gear in a decoupling manner, is disposed at a position closer to an engine than the second gear and on the center axis of the second gear. With such a mechanical arrangement, the invention provides a power transmission apparatus for use with a four-wheel drive vehicle, which is compact in construction, and excellent in on-board property. While there has been described in connection with the preferred embodiments of the invention, it will be understood to those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications may be made therein without departing from the invention, and it is aimed, therefore, to cover in the appended claims all such changes and modifications as fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention. * * * * *",

            "fullText":"  ( 1 of 1 ) United States Patent 6,685,594 Kanazawa February 3, 2004 Differential limiting device for a differential device Abstract A clutch drum is engaged to the rear part of a carrier of a center differential device. A clutch piston, which is rotated together with the rear drive shaft while allowing it to retractively move in a direction along a rear drive shaft, is provided within the clutch drum. Pinion shafts are protruded from the rear end face of the carrier to form protruded parts, which are confronted with the front end face of the clutch piston. A cam part, which is in sliding contact with the protruded parts, is formed on the front end of the clutch piston. When the carrier and the rear drive shaft relatively rotate, the protruded parts retractively move the clutch piston along cam crests of the cam part to press a clutch mechanism.

Description BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a differential limiting device for a differential device, and particularly a differential limiting device for a differential device having a clutch mechanism. By convention, a differential device is provide with a differential limiting device which additionally applies a predetermined differential limiting torque as an initial torque, and when one of the output shafts slips, it transmits a torque to the other output shaft by bypassing the one of output shaft. A differential limiting device comprising a hydraulic multiple disc clutch is known. In a center differential device of the planetary gear type, disclosed in Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No. Hei. 5-112149, a hydraulic multiple disc clutch is provided between a carrier and a drive shaft. The hydraulic multiple disc clutch generates a differential limiting torque depending on a slip of the rear wheel or the like. In this hydraulic multiple disc clutch, a differential limiting torque is generated by a multiple disc type clutch mechanism. Accordingly, a relatively large torque can be generated. On the other hand, the hydraulic multiple disc clutch needs a hydraulic mechanism for carrying out an engaging control of the clutch mechanism. Accordingly, the structure thereof becomes complicated. In some layout of the differential device, it is difficult to secure a hydraulic pressure source. SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTION Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a differential limiting device for a differential device which is capable of performing an engaging control of a multiple disc clutch mechanism with a simple structure. The above-mentioned object can be attained by a differential limiting device for a differential device which limits relative rotations of a shaft for inputting and outputting drive power to a carrier and the carrier aligned with the shaft, the differential limiting device, according to the present invention, comprising: a clutch mechanism aligned with the shaft for engaging the shaft and the carrier; a ring-shaped clutch piston being rotated together with the shaft and being retractively movable in an axial direction of the shaft, thereby pressing the clutch mechanism; protruded parts protruded in the axial direction and each having an end that is confronted with the clutch piston; and cam crests formed on a surface of the clutch piston and confronted with the protruded parts, the cam crests being brought in sliding contact with the ends of the protruded parts respectively; wherein the protruded parts retractively move along the cam crests of the cam part to move the clutch piston in the axial direction when the carrier and the shaft relatively rotate. In an embodiment of the differential limiting device, it is advantageous that the differential device is a planetary gear type differential device including a sun gear provided on the shaft, pinions being meshed with the sun gear, and pinion shafts for rotatably supporting the pinions on the carrier, and wherein the protruded parts are formed with the pinion shafts protruded from the carrier. In addition, in an embodiment of the differential limiting device, it is advantageous that a maximum shift of the clutch piston by the cam crests in the axial direction is smaller than a stroke length of the clutch piston within which the clutch piston is refractively movable, and the cam crests are continuously formed in a ring shape. Further, in an embodiment of the differential limiting device, it is advantageous that each of the cam crests has cam surfaces that are configured to be asymmetrical with respect to a direction of its rotation relative to the protruded part. Furthermore, an embodiment of the differential limiting device according to the present invention may further comprises: elastic members interposed between the clutch piston and the clutch mechanism for pressing the clutch mechanism. Moreover, an embodiment of the differential limiting device according to the present invention may further comprises: an elastic member placed in the clutch mechanism.

In FIG. 1, reference numeral 1 designates a transaxel, vertically mounted, which is a drive system for a four-wheel drive vehicle. The transaxel 1 includes a torque converter case 2 and a differential case 3, which are disposed in the front part of the transaxel 1, while being formed integrally with the transaxel 1. A transmission case 4 is joined to the rear ends of those cases 2 and 3. An extension case 5 is joined to the rear end of the transmission case 4. A power transmission device is installed within the extension case 5. An oil pan 6 is mounted on the lower side of the transmission case 4. Reference numeral 10 designates an engine. A crank shaft 11 of the engine 10 is coupled to the input of a torque converter 13 having a lockup clutch 12, which is disposed within the torque converter case 2. A transmission input shaft 14 of an automatic transmission 30, which is placed in the transmission case 4, is coupled to the output side of the torque converter 13. An output shaft (transmission output shaft) 15 of the automatic transmission 30 is aligned with the input shaft (transmission input shaft) 14. The transmission output shaft 15 is coupled to the input of a center differential device 50, which is placed in the extension case 5. A front drive shaft 16 and a rear drive shaft 20 as a shaft part are coupled in a branched fashion to the output of the center differential device 50. The front drive shaft 16 is disposed in parallel with the input shaft 14 and the transmission output shaft within the transmission case 4. The rear end of the front drive shaft 16 is coupled to the center differential device 50, through a pair of reduction gears 17 and 18. The front end of the front drive shaft 16 is provided to a front differential device 19, which is disposed within the differential case 3. The front wheel output shaft (not shown) for supporting the front wheels by shaft is coupled to the front differential device 19. The rear drive shaft 20 is provided to the rear wheel output shaft (not shown) for supporting the rear wheels by shaft, through a propeller shaft 21, a rear differential device 22, and the like. The automatic transmission 30 includes a front planetary gear 31 and a rear planetary gear 32. In connection with the rear planetary gear 32, the front planetary gear 31 is provided with a high clutch 33, a reverse clutch 34, a brake band 35, a forward clutch 36, an overuning clutch 37, a low/reverse clutch 38, and one-way clutches 39 and 40. Some of those friction engaging elements are selectively engaged, thereby constructing a speed change stage of a forward 4-speed and reverse 1-speed. In the front part of the automatic transmission 30, an oil pump 41 couples an impeller sleeve 13a with a drive shaft 42, and always drives them. A control valve body 43 is contained in the oil pan 6. The control valve body 43 supplies oil to the above friction engaging elements and discharges oil from them, thereby individually controlling the engagement and disengagement of those elements. The center differential device 50 consists of a differential device of the planetary gear type. Specifically, as shown in FIG. 2, a first sun gear 51 of large diameter is integral with the transmission output shaft 15. A plurality (e.g., three) of first pinions 52 of small diameter are engaged with the first sun gear 51, while being equidistantly spaced. A second sun gear 53 of small diameter is integral with the rear drive shaft 20. A plurality (e.g., three) of second pinions 54 of large diagram are meshed with the second sun gear 53, while being equidistantly spaced. The first and second pinions 52 and 54 are formed integrally with pinion members 55, respectively. The pinion members 55 are rotatably supported on pinion shafts 57 fastened to a carrier 56. The transmission output shaft 15 is set at the front end of the carrier 56, and inserted into the carrier and is rotatable therein. The rear drive shaft 20 is set at the rear end of the carrier and inserted into the carrier and is rotatable therein. And the first sun gear 51 and the second sun gear 53 are placed in the central space thereof. The pinion shafts 57 are horizontally arranged so that the first pinions 52 is meshed with the first sun gear 51, and the second pinions 54 is meshed with the second sun gear 53. The reduction gear 17 is fastened to the carrier 56. A drive power that is transmitted through the pinion shafts 57 to the carrier 56, as shown in FIG. 1, is transmitted to the front wheels by way of the reduction gears 17 and 18, the front drive shaft 16 and the front differential device 19. A drive force that is transmitted from the rear drive shaft 20 to the second sun gear 53 is transmitted to the rear wheels by way of the rear differential device 22. A differential limiting device 60 of a multiple disc mechanism type is provided on the rear part of the center differential device 50, thereby effecting a differential limiting between the front and rear wheels. The differential limiting device 60 is made up of a clutch drum 61 fixed to the rear end of the carrier 56, and a clutch hub 62 spline-coupled to the rear drive shaft 20 within the clutch drum 61. A clutch piston 63 is spline-coupled to the outer peripheral surface of the clutch hub 62, and the clutch piston 63 is retractively movable in a direction along the rear drive shaft 20. The clutch piston 63 is spline-coupled to the clutch hub 62, so that it is allowed to refractively move in the direction along the rear drive shaft 20, and it is rotated together with the rear drive shaft 20. As a result, it is refractively and rotatably movable relative to the clutch drum 61. A tubular part 63a is formed integral with the rear end of the clutch piston 63 in a state that the outer peripheral surface of the tubular part 63a is confronted with the inner peripheral surface of the clutch drum 61. A plurality of drive plates 65 spline-coupled to the tubular part 63a and a plurality of driven plates 66 coupled to the clutch drum 61 are alternately arranged along the rear drive shaft 20 between the clutch drum 61 and the tubular part 63a. In the rear part of them, a retainer plate 67 spline-coupled to the clutch drum 61 is engaged and stopped at a snap ring 68, thereby forming a key part of a multiple disc clutch mechanism 70. The rear ends of the pinion shafts 57 are rearwardly extended, and protruded from the rear end of the carrier 56, and those protruded ones form protruded parts 75. Those protruded parts 75 are confronted with the front end of the clutch piston 63 within the clutch drum 61. A cam part 80, which is in sliding contact with the protruded parts 75, is formed on the front end of the clutch piston 63. In the structure of the cam part 80, as shown in FIG. 3, a plurality (three in the embodiment) of cam crests 81 like configured are chained in a ring fashion (The number of cam crests 81 may appropriately be selected if it is within the number of pinion shafts). In each of those cam crests 81, slanted cam surfaces 81b are symmetrically located on both sides of a top surface 81a. Each of the protruded parts 75 is put facing a position between the slanted cam surfaces 81b of the cam crests 81 (see FIG. 4). As shown in FIG. 4, a distance from the front end face of the clutch piston 63 to the top surface 81a is longer than a stroke length of the clutch piston 63 within which the clutch piston 63 is retractively movable. This defines a slidable range of each protruded part 75 over the slanted cam surfaces 81b. An operation of the embodiment thus constructed will be described. A drive force generated by the engine 10 is first input to the input shaft 14 of the automatic transmission 30, through the torque converter 13. A drive force having experienced a predetermined speed change in the automatic transmission 30 is output from the transmission output shaft 15, and input to the first sun gear 51 of the center differential device 50. The first pinions 52 which are meshed with the first sun gear 51, are formed integrally with the second pinions 54 which are meshed with the second sun gear 53 of the rear drive shaft 20. Since the reduction gear 18 of the front drive shaft 16 is meshed with the reduction gear 17 of the carrier 55, which supports the pinions 52 and 54. A torque output from the transmission output shaft 15 is distributed to the rear drive shaft 20 and the front drive shaft 16, through the center differential device 50. A torque distributed to the rear drive shaft 20 is transmitted to the rear wheel output shaft (not shown) for supporting the rear wheels, by way of the rear drive shaft 20, the propeller shaft 21 and the rear differential device 22. A torque distributed to the front drive shaft 16 is transmitted through the front differential device 19 to the front wheel shaft (not shown). As a result, the vehicle runs in four-wheel drive mode. In a case where the vehicle gets out of a bad road, a low .mu. road, or runs in a state that one of the wheels is in a floating state, if a differential revolution occurs between the front and rear wheel transmission shafts, viz., the carrier 56 and the rear drive shaft 20 relatively rotate, the protruded parts 75 and the clutch piston 63 relatively rotate. At this time, the clutch piston 63 is rearwardly moved along the cam crests 81 (slanted cam surfaces 81b) to press the clutch mechanism 60. As a result, the drive plates 65 are brought into sliding contact with the driven plates 66. And a differential limiting torque, which depends on a shift \"1\" quantity (see FIG. 5(b)) of the clutch piston 63, is generated in the differential limiting device 60. When the carrier 56 and the rear drive shaft 20 are further rotated relatively, and the protruded parts 75 reach the ends of sliding ranges of the cam crests 81, the shift quantity \"1\" of the clutch piston 63 is maximized (=stroke length of the clutch piston 63), and the clutch mechanism 60 is completely fastened, so that the center differential device 50 is differentially locked. In the embodiment as mentioned above, the engaging control of the multiple disc clutch mechanism 70 is carried out with a simple structure including the protruded parts 75 provided on the end face of the carrier 56 and the cam part 80 provided on the surface of the clutch piston 63, which is confronted with the protruded parts 75. Therefore, there is no need of using a complicated hydraulic mechanism, and this leads to simplification of the structure of the differential limiting device 60. Further, such a mechanism does not need a hydraulic pressure source and others. Accordingly, a design freedom on the layout of the differential device or the like is increased. Additionally, the pinion shafts 57 are formed protruding from the end face of the carrier 56, so that the number of required parts is reduced. This contributes further structure simplification of the differential limiting device 60. A distance from the front end face of the clutch piston 63 to the top surface 81a of the cam crests 81 is shorter than the stroke length within which the clutch piston 63 is retractively movable (FIG. 6(a)). As a result, the maximum shift \"lmax\" (see FIG. 6(b)) of the clutch piston 63 by the sliding of the protruded parts 75 relative to the cam crests 81 may be set to be smaller than the stroke length. Accordingly, the torque limiter function may be added to the differential limiting device 60. Thus, in the structure mentioned above, when the protruded parts 75 are rotated relative to the clutch piston 63 by a predetermined quantity of rotation, then the sliding surfaces of the cam crests 81 on which the protruded parts 75 slide moves from the slanted cam surfaces 81b to the top surface 81a, and the shift quantity of the clutch piston 63 reaches its maximum value. As a result, the shift quantity of the clutch piston 63 is limited, thereby preventing a torque generated by the multiple disc clutch mechanism 70 from increasing and exceeding a predetermined torque. As shown in FIG. 7, a slanting angle .theta.1 of the slanted cam surface 81b of each of the cam crests 81 is set to be different from a slanting angle .theta.2 of the slanted cam surface 81b. The cam crest 81 is configured to be asymmetrical with respect to a direction of its rotation relative to the protruded part 75. If so done, the characteristic of the differential limiting torque generated in the clutch mechanism 70 may be set so as to vary depending on a direction of the relative rotation of the carrier 56 and the rear drive shaft 20. FIG. 8 is a longitudinal sectional view showing a center differential device which is a second embodiment of the present invention. The second embodiment is different from the first embodiment in that coil springs 92 as elastic members are interposed between the clutch piston 63 and the multiple disc clutch mechanism 70. No description on the remaining portion of the second embodiment which are equal to or resembling the corresponding one of the first embodiment will be given by merely attaching like reference numerals to the related parts. More specifically, a plurality of recesses 91 (only one recess 91 is illustrated in FIG. 8) are formed in the surface of the clutch piston 63, which is confronted with the clutch mechanism 70. The coil spring 92 is held in each of the recesses 91. The rear ends of those coil springs 92 are protruded from the rear end of the clutch piston 63. The quantity of each coil spring 92 is selected to be longer than a gap .delta. between the clutch piston 63 and the multiple disc clutch mechanism 70 under condition that the shift quantity \"1\" of the clutch piston 63 when it is shifted rearwardly is 0.degree.. The coil springs 92 presses the multiple disc clutch mechanism 70 rearward by a given weak force. The second embodiment thus constructed produces the following advantageous effect, in addition to the effect by the first embodiment. Since the clutch piston 63 presses constantly the coil springs 92 by a weak force in the rearward direction, the multiple disc clutch mechanism 70 generates an initial torque. FIG. 9 is a longitudinal sectional view showing a center differential device, which is a third embodiment of the invention. The third embodiment is different from the first embodiment in that a dish spring 95 as an elastic member is placed in the multiple disc clutch mechanism 70. Like reference numerals are used for designating like or equivalent portions in the embodiments mentioned above, for simplicity of explanation. To be more specific, the multiple disc clutch mechanism 70 forms a gap .DELTA. between the retainer plate 67 and the snap ring 68 when the shift quantity \"1\" of the clutch piston 63 when it is shifted rearwardly is 0.degree.. A dish 95 having a squeeze, which is larger than the gap .DELTA., is interposed between the retainer plate 67 and the snap ring 68. The dish spring 95 presses forward the multiple disc clutch mechanism 70 (the drive plates 65 and the driven plates 66, and the like) by a weak force. The third embodiment produces the following advantageous effect in addition to the effect by the first embodiment. Since the dish spring 95 is constantly pressed by a weak force in the forward direction, the multiple disc clutch mechanism 70 generates an initial torque. By appropriately setting a spring constant of the dish spring 95, the characteristic of the torque generated by the multiple disc clutch mechanism 70 may variously be set with respective to the shift quantity of the clutch piston 63. In each embodiment mentioned above, the differential limiting device is provided in the planetary differential device. If required, a protruded part is formed integrally with the carrier of the bevel type differential device, whereby forming a similar differential limiting device is formed. It is evident that the setting of the input and output elements to the differential device is not limited to the above mentioned one. The differential device to which the differential limiting device is applied is not limited to the center differential device. It is readily understood that the differential device may be applied to the front differential device, the rear differential device, or the like. The configuration of the slanted cam surfaces are not limited to the above one, as a matter of course. In an example of another configuration, the slanted cam surfaces are curved, and a lift quantity of the clutch piston with respective to the relative rotations of the clutch piston and the cam is varied in an exponential function fashion. As seen from the foregoing description, when the carrier and the shaft are relatively rotated, the protruded parts formed on the carrier retractively move the clutch piston along the cam crests of the clutch piston, whereby a clutch of the multiple disc type is formed which is capable of engaging the shaft and the carrier. Accordingly, an engaging control of the clutch may be carried out with a simple structure. While there has been described in connection with the preferred embodiments of the invention, it will be understood to those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications may be made therein without departing from the invention, and it is aimed, therefore, to cover in the appended claims all such changes and modifications as fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention. * * * * *",

Description BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a center differential unit including a planetary gear, and particularly to a center differential unit containing a planetary gear used for effectively transmitting power from an engine to driving wheels of a vehicle, which can produce a sufficient differential toque and has an excellent durability. 2. Discussion of the Related Art In a four wheel drive, power from an engine is transmitted to front and rear wheels usually by a center differential unit. In other words, power from the engine is first transmitted to a transmission by way of a clutch. The transmission output is divided by a center differential unit and transmitted to a front differential unit and a rear differential unit. Torque decelerated by the front and rear differential units is conveyed respectively to the front and rear wheels. The center differential unit of a planetary gear type is widely used since it is relatively compact and changes in torque delivery to front and rear wheels is easily controlled. Japanese Patent 2652715 discloses a four wheel drive with a center differential unit having a planetary gear. The center differential unit will now be explained by referring to a schematic cross section of a center differential unit shown in FIG. 5 and a schematic diagram in FIG. 6. An output shaft 101 is connected with a rear drive shaft 102, which transmits power to a rear differential unit by way of a propeller shaft. The output shaft 101 and the rear drive shaft 102 are provided to rotate coaxially via bushings 103 and thrust bearings 104. A reduction gear 105 is supported by the output shaft 101 via the bushings 103 and rotates on the output shaft 101. The reduction gear 105 and the output shaft 101 are supported on a gearbox casing 100 by ball bearings 106. A center differential unit 110 is provided over the output shaft 101, the rear drive shaft 102 and the reduction gear 105 coaxially therewith. The reduction gear 105 meshes with a reduction gear 108 provided on a front drive shaft 107. Here, the front drive shaft 107 functions to transmit power to a front differential unit. The center differential unit 110 includes a large diameter sun gear 111 on the output shaft 101 of a transmission on the input side, a small diameter sun gear 112 on the rear drive shaft 102 on the output side, a small diameter pinion 113 meshed with the large diameter sun gear 111, and a large diameter pinion 114 meshed with the small diameter sun gear 112. The small diameter pinion 113 and the large diameter pinion 114 are provided on a single pinion member 115. Moreover, a supporting plate 117 for a carrier 116 is attached to the rear drive shaft 102 by way of a ball bearing 118. The supporting plate 117 and the reduction gear 105 are united as an integral body, and a pinion shaft 119 extends over the supporting plate 117 and the reduction gear 105. The pinion member 115 is supported by the pinion shaft 119 having needle bearings 120 therebetween. Both ends of the pinion member 115 are supported on the reduction gear 105 and the supporting plate 117 by a thrust washer 122 interposed therebetween. An oil supply hole 121 is perforated on the pinion shaft for supplying oil to the needle bearings 120. For the pinion shaft 119, high-carbon steel or case-hardened steel which has been subjected to a thermal treatment for hardening the surface. In the above-mentioned center differential unit 110 containing a planetary gear of a compound type without a ring gear, differential function is attained by using the large diameter sun gear 111 and the small diameter sun gear 112 with an appropriate number of teeth. A disproportional torque ratio on the rear wheels is provided by appropriately distributing the output torque of the transmission. This is achieved by appropriately setting the distance from the meshing point of the large diameter sun gear 111 and the small diameter pinion 113 to the center of the large diameter sun gear 111, and the distance from the meshing point of the small diameter sun gear 112 and the large diameter pinion 114 to the center of the small diameter sun gear 112. Alternatively, it is possible to use helical gears for the large diameter sun gear 111, small diameter sun gear 112, small diameter pinion 113 and large diameter pinion 114 so as to generate a thrust load. The thrust load causes friction between the edges of the thrust washer 122 and the pinion member 115. In addition, force resulting from a separation load and a tangential load is applied to the small diameter pinion 113, large diameter pinion 114 and a contacting face between the pinion member 115 and the pinion shaft 119 (needle bearings 120). Accordingly, frictional force is generated on the needle bearings 120. Thus, a differential control mechanism is provided. In Japanese Patent 2652715, a radial load is applied to the pinion member 115 depending upon an input torque. In order to eliminate a seizure of the pinion shaft 119 with the pinion member 115, and the galling of these, the needle bearings 120 are provided as bearings for the pinion member 115. The needle bearings 120 can be replaced by bushings. The needle bearing 120 is durable against a large load, but has a small frictional resistance, since it is a rolling bearing. On the other hand, the bushings contact with the pinion member 115 by sliding therebetween. Therefore, the bushing has a large frictional resistance, but a seizure will occur when lubricating oil is in sufficiently supplied. Accordingly, it is difficult to take an appropriate countermeasure when large torque for reducing differential action is required based on a load when traveling for instance on a muddy road or a road with a bad surface condition. Usually, metal materials are employed for the pinion member 115 and the pinion shaft 119 in order to attain a sufficient strength. When large torque for reducing differential action is necessary, it is possible to increase friction between the pinion member 115 and the pinion shaft 119 by supporting the pinion member directly on the pinion shaft 119 without providing the needle bearing 120 or the bushing. In this case, however, it is impossible for the pinion shaft 119 and the pinion member to endure such a large stress, which causes seizure. Alternatively, if forced lubrication is carried out so as to prevent the seizure, the frictional resistance between the pinion shaft 119 and the pinion member 115 is decreased. In order to obtain sufficient friction, it is effective to use a paper material, which is usually used as a friction material for a multi-plate clutch for an automatic transmission, by interposing the paper material between the pinion shaft 119 and the pinion member 115. However, the paper material is not suitable for practical use when lubricating oil containing an additive of a mineral material is used for the differential gear. This is because the durability of the paper friction material is largely decreased due to absorption of such oil. In this way, it is difficult to obtain both sufficient friction and torque for reducing differential action. OBJECT AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is therefore a first object of the present invention to provide a center differential unit of a planetary gear type which provides torque for reducing differential action corresponding to an input torque in addition to maintaining a stable function of a planetary gear contained therein by obtaining a sufficient frictional force between a pinion shaft and a pinion member without interposing a bearing or a bushing therebetween and efficiently eliminating a seizure therebetween, comprising a carrier; a first sun gear for receiving an output from a transmission and positioned interiorly of the carrier; a second sun gear provided on an output side with respect to the first sun gear and positioned interiorly of the carrier; a first pinion meshing with the first sun gear; a second pinion meshing with the second sun gear; a pinion member carrying the first pinion and the second pinion therearound, the pinion member having a shaft-receiving hole; and a pinion shaft having at least a surface of carbon/carbon composite, the pinion shaft supported by the carrier at one end on the output side and directly supporting the pinion member so as to rotate by being inserted into the shaft-receiving hole of the pinion member.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION A first embodiment of a center differential unit containing a planetary gear of the present invention will be explained by referring to figures. (First Embodiment) In the first embodiment, a manual transmission is used. FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram of the transmission; FIG. 2 is a schematic cross section of a center differential unit; and FIG. 3 is a perspective view of the center differential unit. FIG. 1 shows that a transmission casing 1, a transfer casing 2 and an extension casing 3 are connected. An engine 10 has a crank shaft 11 connected to a clutch 13 via a flywheel 12, and an intermediate shaft 14 extends from the clutch 13 to a sub-transmission 15. In the sub-transmission 15, a constant mesh type counter gear mechanism 17, and a synchronizing mechanism 18 are provided between the intermediate shaft 14 and an input shaft 16. By this structure, high and low speed switching is performed. The input shaft 16 extends into a manual transmission 30. An output shaft 19 of the manual transmission 30 is provided in parallel with the input shaft 16. The input shaft 16 is led into a center differential unit 50 contained in the extension casing 3. The output shaft 19 has a cylindrical shape, and a front drive shaft 20 contains the output shaft 19. The center differential unit 50 is connected with a front differential unit 21 provided in the sub-transmission 15 at a bottom part thereof by way of the center differential unit 50. Torque is conveyed from the front differential unit 21 to front wheels. A rear drive shaft 23 is arranged in the extension casing 3 at the same height as the input shaft 16 in the manual transmission 30. A rear output shaft 56 and the rear drive shaft 23 are linked with each other by way of a pair of transfer gears 24, 25. Torque from the rear drive shaft 23 is transmitted to a propeller shaft 26, a rear differential unit 27 and rear wheels. The manual transmission 30 is a constant mesh type, and a first gear train 31, a second gear train 32, a third gear train 33, a fourth gear train 34, a fifth gear train 35, and synchronizing mechanisms 36, 37 and 38 are arranged over the input shaft 16 and the output shaft 19 provided in parallel with each other. Further, a reverse gear train 39 is positioned between the first gear train 31 and the second gear train 32. By selectively operating the synchronizing mechanisms 36, 37 and 38, the first to the fifth speed are selected. The reverse gear train 39 provides reverse drive. As shown in FIG. 2, the output shaft 19 extends into the center differential unit 50. The center differential unit 50 contains a center differential input shaft 52, a front output shaft 54 and a rear output shaft 56. The center differential input shaft 52 has a cylindrical shape and one end of the center differential input shaft 52 covers an outer surface of the output shaft 19 at an end by a spline connection through an intermediate member 51. The front output shaft 54 also has a cylindrical shape and is contained in the hollow portion of the center differential input shaft 52. One end of the front output shaft 54 is connected with the front drive shaft 20 so as to cover an end outer surface of the front drive shaft 20 by a spline connection having an intermediate member therebetween. Furthermore, the front output shaft 54 contains therein a top portion of the rear output shaft 56. The center differential input shaft 52, the front output shaft 54 and the rear output shaft 56 coaxially rotate on each other. A large diameter sun gear 60 is provided at a base end of the center differential input shaft 52 as an integral body. A small diameter pinion 61 is in mesh with the large diameter sun gear 60. On the other hand, a small diameter sun gear 63 is linked with the rear output shaft 56 by a spline connection so as to be provided at an intermediate part of the output shaft 56. A large diameter pinion 64 is in mesh with the small diameter sun gear 63. The small diameter pinion 61 and the large diameter pinion 64 are formed integrally with a hollow pinion member 65 which has a hole 65a for receiving a pinion shaft 67. Thus, the first and large diameter pinions 61 and 64 are supported on the pinion shaft 67 fixed to a carrier 66. The center differential input shaft 52 is inserted from the front to the carrier 66, and the rear output shaft 56 is inserted from the back so as to rotate. The carrier 66 contains the large diameter sun gear 60 and the small diameter sun gear 63 at an intermediate space as shown in FIG. 3. A planetary gear is structured by the provision of the pinion shaft 67 with the small diameter pinion 61 meshed with the large diameter sun gear 60 and the large diameter pinion 64 with the small diameter sun gear 63. In the present invention, a carbon/carbon composite (hereinafter referred to as C/C composite) is used for the pinion shaft 67. The C/C composite is a material prepared by impregnating carbon fibers, carbon textile or carbon filament/yarn with a thermosetting resin or a thermoplastic resin to obtain an impregnated material, followed by calcinating the impregnated material at a high temperature under a high pressure. Namely, the C/C composite is prepared by reinforcing a carbon matrix with carbon fibers. The thus obtained graphited C/C composite is used for the pinion shaft 67. The conventional C/C composite has a bending strength of less than 200 MPa. In the present invention, it is preferable to use C/C composite having a bending strength in the range of 200 MPa to 1200 MPa, a compressive strength in the range of 100 MPa to 800 MPa, and an interlaminar shear strength in the range of 20 MPa to 600 MPa. When the C/C composite has the excellent mechanical strengths in the above range, it is possible to obtain a smaller member for the planetary gear, which is preferable for the industrial use. The C/C composite is light and has an excellent thermal resistance, pressure resistance and abrasion resistance. Moreover, the C/C composite has a coefficient of friction which is appropriate for sliding contact with other members, and self-lubricating properties due to action of the carbon content as a lubricant. Therefore, it is possible to provide the pinion shaft 67 which is light in weight and has satisfactory friction contact with the pinion member 65 when in sliding contact therewith. Furthermore, it is possible to eliminate or minimize the seizure or undesired abrasion of the pinion shaft 67 with the pinion member 65 by use of the pinion shaft made of the C/C composite even when other lubrication cannot be sufficiently performed. The C/C composite is a porous material, thereby having excellent permeability and retention when lubricating oil is added to the C/C composite. The small diameter pinion 61 and the large diameter pinion 64 are spaced from each other on the pinion shaft 67 and are arranged at an internal part of the carrier 66. The carrier 66 has a hub 70 on the internal surface. The hub 70 extends from a gap between the large diameter sun gear 60 and the small diameter sun gear 63 to the inside of the center differential input shaft 52 and is linked with the outer surface of the front output shaft 54 by the spline connection. By this configuration, power transmitted to the carrier 66 via the pinion shaft 67 is transmitted to the hub 70, the front output shaft 54 and the front drive shaft 20. On the other hand, power transmitted to the rear output shaft 56 by way of the small diameter sun gear 63 is transmitted to the rear drive shaft 23 via transfer gears 24 and 25. At the back side of the carrier 66, a cylindrical clutch hub 75 is supported by the rear output shaft 56 via a thrust bearing so as to rotate around the rear output shaft 56. A clutch drum 76 is fixed on the rear output shaft 56 and faces the clutch hub 75. A drive plate 77, a driven plate 78, and a cone disc spring 79 are provided between the clutch hub 75 and the clutch drum 76. The clutch hub 75, the clutch drum 76, the drive plate 77, the driven plate 78, and the cone disc spring 79 constitute an initial torque generating unit 80. The initial torque generating unit 80 is for generating a predetermined quantity of torque for limiting differential action (herein after referred to as \"differential limiting torque\") based on torque between the carrier 66 and the rear output shaft 56, that is, differential rotation between the front and rear wheels. The initial torque can be determined by appropriately selecting the pressing force created by the cone disc spring 79. The center differential unit 50 can be controlled to appropriately distribute a reference torque, for instance to provide a suitable disproportional torque distribution by providing a larger torque for the rear wheels. This control is made by properly setting the distance from the meshing point of the large diameter sun gear 60 and the small diameter pinion 61 to the center of the large diameter sun gear 60, and the distance from the meshing point of the small diameter sun gear 63 and the large diameter pinion 64 to the center of the small diameter sun gear 63. A first friction washer 81, a second friction washer 82, and a third friction washer 83 are interposed respectively between the large diameter sun gear 60 and the hub 70, between the hub 70 and the small diameter sun gear 63 and between the small diameter sun gear 63 and the carrier 66. A differential control mechanism of the center differential unit 50 is obtained by the frictional force generated by the friction washers 81, 82 and 83, and that generated between the pinion shaft 67 and the hole 65a of the pinion member 65 for receiving a pinion shaft 67. In this embodiment, it is preferable to use helical gears for the large diameter sun gear 60, small diameter pinion 61, small diameter sun gear 63 and large pinion 64. The threads of the helical gears are so structured that the small diameter pinion 61 applies a thrust load to urge the large diameter sun gear 60 to the rear side, i.e., to the hub side, and that the large diameter pinion 64 applies a thrust load to urge the small diameter sun gear 63 to the front side, i.e., to the hub side when the vehicle goes forward. In the case where the vehicle goes forward, the first friction washer 81 and the second friction washer 82 are pressed to the hub 70 by the large diameter sun gear 60 and the small diameter sun gear 63 to generate frictional force. In the case where the vehicle goes back, the thrust load of the small diameter sun gear works in a reversed direction, so that the third friction washer 83 is pressed to the carrier 66 by the large diameter sun gear 63 to give frictional force. Force results from a separation load and a tangential load on the meshing point of the large diameter sun gear 60 and the small diameter pinion 61, and on the meshing point of the small diameter sun gear 63 and the large diameter pinion 64 can be applied to a supporting part between the pinion shaft 67 and the small diameter pinion 61/large diameter pinion 63. Namely, the force is applied to the part between the pinion member 65 and the pinion shaft 67, whereby friction is obtained therebetween. The thus obtained frictional force between the pinion member 65 and the pinion shaft 67 works as frictional torque in a reversed direction with respect to the rotation of the pinion member 65, namely, as torque for reducing the differential. Thus, the structure with the helical gears is effective to generate torque for restricting the differential depending upon the input force. Depending upon the difference of the rotation number of front wheels from that of rear wheels, the rotating directions of the pinions are changed. In this case, the functioning manner of the differential limiting torque also varies. In operation, differential action brought about by the function of differential limiting torque is automatically modified, when the vehicle turns under the situation where the rotation number of the front wheels is larger than that of the rear wheels, when the front wheels slip, and when the rear wheels slip under the situation where the rotation number of the front wheels is less than that of the rear wheels. The function of the center differential unit 50 will be explained in detail. When the clutch 13 is disengaged and gears are engaged for running forward while stopping or traveling, the synchronizing mechanism 36, 37 or 38 is engaged with one of the first to fifth gear trains 31 to 35 (FIG. 1). The selected gear train synchronizes with the input shaft 16. In this state, by letting the clutch 13 in, power from the engine 10 is input to the input shaft 16 of the manual transmission 30 via the sub-transmission 15. The power varied by the selected transmission gear train is transmitted to the output shaft 19. When the clutch 13 is disengaged and the reverse gear train 36 is engaged, power in a reversed direction is output to the output shaft 19. In this way, 5 gearing states for forward movement and one gearing stage for backward movement are selected. Power transmitted to the output shaft 19 is input into the large diameter sun gear 60 by way of the center differential input shaft 52 in the center differential unit 50. Output from the large diameter sun gear 60 is transmitted to the pinion member 65 via the small diameter pinion 61. When the vehicle goes forward, the center differential unit 50 distributes torque to the front and rear wheels depending on the conditions of the gears. The power transmitted from the carrier 66 is transmitted to the front wheels by way of the hub 70, the front output shaft 54, the front drive shaft 20, and the front differential unit 21. On the other hand, power transmitted via the large diameter sun gear 63 is transmitted to the rear output shaft 56, the transfer gears 24 and 25, the rear drive shaft 23, the propeller shaft 26 and the rear differential unit 27. For torque transmission, initial torque is generated by the force of the cone disc spring 79 pressing the drive plate 77 and the driven plate 78 in the initial torque generating unit 80, which is designed to produce a predetermined initial torque. The initial torque is applied to a portion between the carrier 66 and the rear output shaft 56. By the differential relation between the front and rear wheels, a thrust load is generated corresponding to the input torque. The thrust load obtained by the small diameter pinion 61 urging the large diameter sun gear 60 backward and the large diameter pinion 64 urging the small diameter sun gear 63 forward. Then, frictional force is generated between the large diameter sun gear 60 and the hub 70, and between the small diameter sun gear 63 and the hub 70 by way of the first and second friction washers 81 and 82. The force, which is resulted from a separation load and a tangential load on the meshing point of the large diameter sun gear 60 and the small diameter pinion 61, and on the meshing point of the small diameter sun gear 63 and the large diameter pinion 64, is applied to the portion between the pinion member 65 and the pinion shaft 67 depending on the input torque value, whereby friction is obtained therebetween. The friction works as frictional torque in a reversed direction against the differential rotation of the pinion member 65. In other words, the friction is obtained as differential limiting torque, whereby a performance of the vehicle to run on a rough road surface, and driving stability are obtained. For going backward, a thrust load on the small diameter sun gear 63 is obtained in a reversed direction by the differential rotation between the front and rear wheels, and the small diameter sun gear 63 presses the third friction washer 83 to the carrier 66, thereby giving frictional force. Furthermore, the force which is resulted from a separation load and a tangential load on the meshing point of the large diameter sun gear 60 and the small diameter pinion 61, and on the meshing point of the small sun gear 63 and the large diameter pinion 64, is applied to the portion between the pinion member 65 and the pinion shaft 67. Accordingly, friction is obtained between the pinion member 65 and the pinion shaft 67. The friction works as frictional torque in a reversed direction against the rotation of the pinion member 65. In other words, the friction is obtained as the differential limiting torque, whereby an excellent performance of the vehicle to run on a rough road surface, and driving stability are obtained. Since the pinion shaft 67 is made of C/C composite which has a sufficient coefficient of friction, it is possible to directly support the pinion member 65 around the pinion shaft 67. The pinion member is supported by directly bearing when the pinion shaft 67 is brought into contact with other members by sliding therewith. Therefore, it is possible to maintain a satisfactory frictional force between the pinion shaft 67 and the pinion member 65. As a result, the seizure between the pinion shaft 67 and the pinion member 65 can be effectively prevented, and necessary differential limiting torque can be obtained. Namely, the ability of the vehicle to run a long distance or to run on a bad road, and the driving stability are obtained. In addition to the above, the pinion shaft 67 of the present invention has self-lubricating properties due to the C/C composite when in sliding contact with other members. Further, the pinion shaft 67 has excellent permeability and retention, and stable lubricating properties, when lubricating oil is added to the porous C/C composite. Therefore, the planetary gear and the center differential unit containing the planetary gear has sufficient durability and can be used for a long period time in a stable condition since the seizure or undesired abrasion of the pinion shaft 67 and the pinion member 56 is eliminated. Simultaneously, a sufficient friction between the pinion member 65 and the pinion shaft 68 is obtained. Furthermore, it is possible to use oil for a manual transmission as a lubricant, that is convenient for practical use. The weight of the pinion shaft 67 made of C/C composite is largely reduced in comparison with conventional pinion shafts made of metal materials. It is possible to support the pinion member 65 directly by the pinion shaft 67 without using a needle bearing or a bushing. Consequently, there are such advantages that the number of the members is reduced, the shape/structure of the pinion shaft 67 is simple without having a lubricating-oil supply hole, assembling work is easy, and the manufacturing cost is largely reduced. It is also possible to prepare the pinion shaft 67 with a cylindrical C/C composite containing a steel core material as an integral structure. (Second Embodiment) A second embodiment of the present invention will be explained by referring to FIG. 4. In FIG. 4, members corresponding to those in FIG. 2 are indicated by the same reference numerals, and the detailed explanations on these common members are omitted. The pinion member 65 is formed as an integral body with the small diameter pinion 61 and the large diameter pinion 64. The pinion member 65 has the hole 65a for receiving a pinion shaft 69. Inside the hole 65a, a cylindrical bearing 68 made of the C/C composite is provided on the inner face of the shaft-receiving hole 65a as an integral structure. The pinion shaft 69 is made of a steel material and fixed to the carrier 66 by inserting the pinion shaft 69 in the bearing 68 with both ends fixed to the carrier 66. The bearing 68 used for the present invention is integral with the pinion member 65. The pinion member 65 is directly supported by the pinion shaft 69 without having needle bearings or bearings of any other separate types therebetween. By using the C/C composite for the bearing 68, the weight of the pinion member 65 is decreased, and the bearing 68 and the pinion shaft 69 which slide on each other produce sufficient friction. Even when other lubrication cannot be sufficiently performed, it is possible to eliminate or minimize the seizure or undesired abrasion of the pinion shaft 69 with the pinion member 65. The center differential unit 50 distributes torque to the front and rear wheels depending on the conditions of the gears when the vehicle goes forward. The power transmitted from the carrier 66 is transmitted to the front wheels by the hub 70, the front output shaft 54, the front drive shaft 20, and the front differential unit 21. On the other hand, the power transmitted via the large sun gear 63 is transmitted to the rear output shaft 56, the transfer gears 24 and 25, the rear drive shaft 23, the propeller shaft 26 and the rear differential unit 27. For torque transmission, initial torque is generated by the force of the cone disc spring 79 pressing the drive plate 77 and the driven plate 78 in the initial torque generating unit 80, which is designed to produce a predetermined initial torque. The initial torque is applied to the portion between the carrier 66 and the rear output shaft 56. A thrust load is generated corresponding to the input torque by the differential relation between the front and rear wheels. The thrust load is obtained by the small diameter pinion 61 urging the large diameter sun gear 60 backward and the large diameter pinion 64 urging the small diameter sun gear 63 forward. Then, frictional force is generated between the large diameter sun gear 60 and the hub 70, and between the small diameter sun gear 63 and the hub 70 by way of the first and second friction washers 81 and 82. The force, which is resulted from a separation load and a tangential load on the meshing point of the large diameter sun gear 60 and the small diameter pinion 61, and on the meshing point of the small diameter sun gear 63 and the large diameter pinion 64, is applied to the small diameter pinion 61, the large diameter pinion 64 and the pinion shaft 69. Therefore, the frictional force generates at a portion between the bearing 68 and the pinion shaft 69. The friction works as differential limiting torque, whereby the performance of the vehicle to run on a bad road, and the driving stability are obtained. For going backward, a thrust load on the small diameter sun gear 63 is obtained in a reversed direction by the differential rotation between the front and rear wheels, and the small diameter sun gear 63 presses the third friction washer 83 to the carrier 66, thereby giving frictional force. Furthermore, the force which is resulted from a separation load and a tangential load on the meshing point of the large diameter sun gear 60 and the small diameter pinion 61, and on the meshing point of the small diameter sun gear 63 and the large diameter pinion 64, is applied to the portion between the bearing 68 and the pinion shaft 69. Accordingly, friction between the bearing 68 and the pinion shaft 69 works as frictional torque in a reversed direction against the rotation of the pinion member 65. In other words, the friction is obtained as the differential limiting torque, whereby the performance of the vehicle to run on a bad road, and driving stability are obtained. Since the pinion shaft 69 is made of a steel material and the bearing 68 which is integral with the pinion member 65 is made of C/C composite, the pinion shaft 69 is supported by the pinion member 65 with maintaining a sufficient frictional force therebetween. As a result, the seizure between the pinion shaft 69 and the bearing 68 can be effectively prevented, and necessary differential limiting torque can be obtained. Namely, the ability of the vehicle to run on the rough road surface, and the driving stability are obtained. Moreover, it is possible to eliminate the seizure or undesired abrasion of the pinion shaft 69 with the bearing 68 because of the stable lubricating properties. Therefore, the durability of the members are obtained, and hence the planetary gear and the center differential unit 50 containing the same can be used in a stable condition for a long period of time. As previously mentioned, the pinion shaft 69 directly supports the pinion member 65 containing the bearing 68 without interposing a needle bearing therebetween. Therefore, the number of the structural members is decreased and the pinion shaft 69 has a simple structure without necessity to have a lubricating oil supply hole. Due to the simple structure, the assembling is simplified and a large manufacturing cost reduction can be attained. The central transmission unit and the planetary gear according to the present invention are also applicable to an automatic transmission. Further, it is possible that the output from the second sun gear is transmitted to the front differential unit and the output from the carrier is transmitted to the rear differential unit. The planetary gear of the invention can be widely used for other devises than the center differential unit. As clearly understood from the above, the planetary gear of the present invention or the planetary gear contained in the center differential unit of the present invention has a pinion shaft made of C/C composite at least on the surface, or the pinion member which is integral with a bearing made of C/C composite for supporting a pinion shaft made of a steel material. According to this structure, it is possible to obtain a sufficient friction between the pinion shaft and the pinion member or the pinion shaft and the bearing provided on the pinion member with maintaining differential limiting torque. Simultaneously, it is possible for the planetary gear or the center differential unit to have stable properties by eliminating the seizure of the pinion shaft with the pinion member. In the present invention, a needle bearing or bushing as a separate member is not necessary of supporting a pinion member on a pinion shaft. Therefore, it is possible to reduce the number of members to be used. The structure of the planetary gear is simplified, and the manufacturing cost is largely reduced. The present invention being thus described, it will be clearly understood that the same may be varied in many ways. Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the present invention, and all such modification as would be easily understood to one skilled in the art are intended to be included within the scope of the appended claims. * * * * *",

Description BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a power distribution apparatus for a four-wheel drive vehicle. The power distribution apparatus efficiently distributes drive force from a transmission, which is connected to a transversely laid out engine, to front and rear wheels via a hydraulic multi-plate clutch that is disposed together with required constituent components thereof efficiently. In a conventional power distribution apparatus for a four-wheel drive vehicle, a distribution of a predetermined power to front and rear wheels is usually accomplished by controlling a clamping force of a hydraulic multi-plate clutch as a transfer clutch. For controlling the clamping force of the hydraulic multi-plate clutch, it is required to have at least an oil pressure control portion having a control valve for varying the clamping force of the hydraulic multi-plate clutch, and an oil pressure source for generating an oil pressure for the hydraulic multi-plate clutch. As the most popular case of an arrangement of an engine, the engine is arranged on a front side of a vehicle body in order to secure a passenger space as wide as possible in the vehicle body. In addition, as the arrangement of the engine, a transversal arrangement is adopted in such a manner that an output shaft of the engine is disposed in parallel with a wheel shaft. This construction also applies to a four-wheel drive vehicle. As a four-wheel drive vehicle having a transversely laid out front engine which is described above, for example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. Hei. 6-92156 discloses a construction in which a hydraulic multi-plate clutch distributes to the rear wheel side, a predetermined drive force inputted into a differential from a transmission. The hydraulic multi-plate clutch is mounted on a front drive shaft beside a differential for the front wheels. In addition, Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No. Hei 6-107019 discloses a four-wheel drive vehicle having a hydraulic multi-plate clutch. The hydraulic multi-plate clutch that distributes a drive force to the rear wheel side is provided between a rear end of a gear shaft extending rearwards from one of a pair of direction changing gears for changing a drive force transmission direction to the rear wheel side and a distal end of a propeller shaft. However, in a case where the hydraulic multi-plate clutch is disposed on the axis of the front drive shaft as described in the former example of the conventional power distribution apparatus, a large modification needs to be made to a two-wheel drive portion including the front differential. This makes it difficult to use a transaxle for a two-wheel drive vehicle commonly for a four-wheel drive vehicle. In addition, in a case where the hydraulic multi-plate clutch is provided between the rear end of the gear shaft extending rearward and the distal end of the propeller shaft as done in the latter example of the conventional power distribution apparatus, the diameter of the clutch portion of the transfer unit is increased longitudinally and this leads to the enlargement of the transfer unit. In addition, this enlarged portion of the clutch portion typically runs across the vehicle body chassis structure such as a steering gearbox and a cross member thereabove or therebelow. Therefore in order to maintain a good positional relationship between those members and the transfer unit, the steering gearbox needs to be re-located and the cross member needs to be curved, thus making the vehicle structure complex. In addition, allowing the enlarged hydraulic clutch portion to run across the steering gearbox and the cross member thereabove or therebelow unfavorably reduces the space within the passenger compartment and lowers the minimum road clearance of the vehicle. Furthermore, since the oil pressure control mechanism portion and the oil pressure source is provided in the hydraulic multi-plate clutch as described before, these members need to be disposed efficiently within a limited space. Because of these conventional arrangements, consideration is required in maintaining the oil-tightness of the difference in nature between the operating fluid for operating the hydraulic multi-plate clutch and the gear fluid within the transfer unit. In addition, consideration is also required to be given to the productivity of transmissions and transfer units, as well as the easy access to the transmission and the transfer unit for servicing them for maintenance after they are disposed on the vehicle. SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTION The present invention was made in view of the above problems and objects thereof are to provide a power distribution apparatus for a four-wheel drive vehicle which is compact in size, which is subject to no limitations as to the apparatus' position relative to the vehicle body structure such as the steering gearbox and the cross member, which can secure with ease the oil-tightness for hydraulic fluid for operating the hydraulic multi-plate clutch, which is superior in providing good productivity of transmissions and transfer units and serviceability thereof for maintenance after they are installed, and which is easy to be installed on the vehicle. With a view to attain the above objects, according to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a power distribution apparatus for a four-wheel drive vehicle comprising: a transversely laid out front engine outputting a drive force via a transmission coupled thereto; a transfer unit including: a pair of direction changing gears for changing a transmission direction of the drive force to a rear direction of the vehicle; a first gear provided on a gear shaft extending rearward from one of the pair of direction changing gears; a second gear adapted to mesh with the first gear so as to transfer the drive force transmission direction to be in parallel with the rear direction; an output shaft adapted to rotatably pass through an axial center of a gear shaft of the second gear so as to output the drive force to the rear direction of the vehicle; a hydraulic multi-plate clutch for variably transmitting torque between the gear shaft of the second gear and the output shaft; and an oil pressure control mechanism integrally incorporating at least an oil pressure source for generating a hydraulic oil pressure for the hydraulic multi-plate clutch and an oil pressure control portion for controlling the clamping force of the hydraulic multi-plate clutch; wherein the hydraulic multi-plate clutch is disposed on the axial center of the second gear at a position closer to the engine than the second gear, the oil pressure control mechanism portion is disposed close to a side of the hydraulic multi-plate clutch, and the drive force is distributed to rear wheels via the hydraulic multi-plate clutch of the transfer unit disposed to the rear of the engine. According to a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided a power distribution apparatus for a four-wheel drive vehicle as set forth in the first aspect of the present invention, wherein the hydraulic multi-plate clutch and the oil pressure control mechanism portion are accommodated and disposed independently and oil-tightly relative to a gear mechanism portion. According to a third aspect of the present invention, there is provided a power distribution apparatus for a four-wheel drive vehicle as set forth in the first or second aspect of the present invention, wherein an accommodation chamber for accommodating therein the hydraulic multi-plate clutch has an opening in one side thereof, and where a member for closing the opening is the oil pressure control mechanism portion. Namely, in the power distribution apparatus for a four-wheel drive vehicle according to the first aspect of the present invention, the transmission direction of the drive force from the transmission coupled to the transversely laid out front engine is changed to the rear by way of the pair of direction changing gears. The drive force is transmitted from the first gear, which is provided on the gear shaft extending to the rear from one of the pair of direction changing gears, to the second gear, so that the transmission direction of the drive force is transfered in parallel. Then, when the control valve in the oil pressure control portion is actuated so that the predetermined oil pressure is applied to the hydraulic multi-plate clutch by the hydraulic fluid, the hydraulic multi-plate clutch is clamped. The drive force corresponding to the clamping force of the clutch is then transmitted from the gear shaft of the second gear to the output shaft. Therefore, the transmitted drive force is outputted to the rear wheel side. Here, since the hydraulic multi-plate clutch is disposed between the second gear and the engine, the transfer unit can be constructed and laid out in a compact manner in both transverse and longitudinal directions. In addition, the hydraulic multi-plate clutch is subject to little positional limitation relative to the vehicle body structure such as the steering gearbox and the cross member, thus providing superior mounting properties. Furthermore, because the hydraulic multi-plate clutch is disposed between the second gear and the engine, the oil pressure control portion and the oil pressure source may be integrally coupled together disposed at the substantially horizontal side position on the hydraulic multi-plate clutch as the oil pressure control mechanism portion. This allows the oil pressure control mechanism portion to be disposed closer to the relatively spacious rear of the engine, thereby solving the problem that the oil pressure control mechanism portion occupies the space on the transmission side. In addition, since the oil pressure control mechanism portion is constructed by integrally coupling the oil pressure control portion and the oil pressure source, as with the power distribution apparatus for a four-wheel drive vehicle according to the second aspect of the present invention, the hydraulic multi-plate clutch and the oil pressure control mechanism portion are accommodated and disposed independently and in an oil-tight manner relative to the gear mechanism portion, whereby the oil-tightness can easily be secured relative to the other transmission oil and the like. Furthermore, since the oil pressure control mechanism portion is constructed by integrally coupling the oil pressure control portion and the oil pressure source, there is no need to form oil paths or the like on the transmission side. Therefore, the transmission can be commonly used for both two-wheel drive vehicles and four-wheel drive vehicles. Moreover, the productivity of transfer units and the serviceability thereof for maintenance after installation can be improved. According to the third aspect of the present invention, there is provided the power distribution apparatus for a four-wheel drive vehicle as set forth in the first or second aspect of the present invention, wherein the transfer unit further includes an accommodation chamber for accommodating the hydraulic multi-plate clutch therein, the accommodation chamber has an opening in one side thereof, and where the opening is closed by the oil pressure control mechanism portion. Thus, the power distribution apparatus can be made more space efficient and the serviceability for maintenance can also be improved.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Embodiments of the present invention will be described hereinafter with reference to appended drawings. FIGS. 1 to 3 show an embodiment according to the present invention. FIG. 1 is a sectional view of a main part of a transfer unit, FIG. 2 is a schematic explanatory view of a positional relationship of an oil pressure control circuit and the like as viewed from the direction of a front wheel shaft, and FIG. 3 is a block diagram explaining the function of power distribution control and the construction of an oil pressure control mechanism portion. In FIG. 1, reference numeral 1 denotes a transversely laid out engine in a front engine compartment of a vehicle, and a transmission 2 coupled with the engine 1 is disposed on an output shaft of the engine 1 in the left-hand side of the hood. In addition, a transfer unit 3 is integrally provided with the engine 1 and the transmission 2 and disposed at the rear part of the engine 1 and the transmission 2, whereby a drive force outputted from the engine 1 is subject to a predetermined speed change at the transmission and is then distributed to a rear wheel side by the transfer unit 3. Here, as shown in the figure, the transfer unit 3 is disposed to the rear of the transmission 2 in such a manner as to be offset toward the engine 1 side. The transfer unit 3 is constituted by a gear mechanism portion 7 for transmitting power, which is transmitted to a differential case 6 of a front differential 5 for transmitting drive force from the transmission 2 to a front wheel side and to the rear wheel side. The transfer unit 3 is further constituted by a hydraulic multi-plate clutch 8 acting as a transfer clutch for continuously variably controlling the distribution of the drive force to the rear wheel side in accordance with running conditions and driving conditions. The front differential 5 is integrally accommodated in a differential accommodating compartment 10. The gear mechanism 7 is integrally accommodated in a gear accommodating compartment 11 formed in a transfer case 9. The hydraulic multi-plate clutch 8 is integrally accommodated in a clutch accommodating compartment 12 formed in the transfer case 9. The front differential 5 comprises a final gear 17 around the outer circumference of the differential case 6. This final gear 17 is adapted to mesh with a drive gear 16 fixedly provided on an output shaft 15 of the transmission 2. The front differential 5 is a known bevel gear type differential and is constituted by a pair of differential pinions 21, 21 and left and right side gears 22L, 22R. The pair of differential pinions 21, 21 are rotatably supported on a pinion shaft 20 fixedly provided within the differential case 6. The left and right side gears 22L, 22R are adapted to mesh with the differential pinions 21, 21. In addition, left and right front wheel drive shafts 25L, 25R are fitted in the left and right side gears 22L, 22R via tube portions 26L, 26R extending transversely from the differential case 6. Thus, the drive force transmitted to the side gears 22L, 22R from the differential case 6 via the differential pinions 21, 21 is then transmitted to left and right front wheels via the drive shafts 25L, 25R of the left and right front wheels. In addition, the right side tube portion 26R of the differential case 6 is extended to the interior of the gear accommodating compartment 11. The drive force is transmitted to the gear mechanism portion 7 via the extended right side tube portion 26R. An oil seal 27 retained on the transfer case 9 is slidably connected to the outer circumference of the right side tube portion 26R at an intermediate position along the length thereof. Therefore, the oil-tightness within the differential accommodating compartment 10 and the gear accommodating compartment 11 is maintained. Note that in the case where lubricating oil for lubricating the front differential 5 and lubricating oil for lubricating the gear mechanism portion 7 are the same, the oil seal 27 may be omitted. The gear mechanism portion 7 comprises a pair of direction changing gears (first and second direction changing gears) 30, 31 comprising in turn hypoid gears and a pair of gears (first and second gears) 32, 33 comprising in turn helical gears. The first direction changing gear 30 is fixedly provided on a hollow transfer shaft 34 that is spline-fitted on the outer circumference of a distal end of the tube portion 26R. The second direction changing gear 31 meshes with the first direction changing gear 30 to thereby change the transmission direction of the drive force to the rear. A gear shaft (a pinion shaft) 31a of the second direction changing gear 31 extends rearwardly. The first gear 32 is spline fitted on a rear end of this pinion shaft 31a. The second gear 33 meshes with the first gear 32 at a right side position of the first gear 32. A gear shaft 33a of the second gear 33 is formed hollow, and an output shaft 35 for outputting the drive force to the rear is allowed to rotatably pass through the hollow gear shaft 33a. In addition, the output shaft 35 is clamped to be freely disengaged with transfer clutch torque. The transfer clutch torque is set by a drive force distribution control portion 70, which will be described later, and imparted by an oil pressure control mechanism portion 50 via the gear shaft 33a of the second gear 33 and the hydraulic multi-plate clutch 8. Namely, the hydraulic multi-plate clutch 8 may be a torque transmission capacity variable transfer clutch. When the hydraulic multi-plate clutch 8 is clamped with a predetermined transfer clutch torque, the drive force transmitted to the second gear 33 is distributed to the output shaft 35 according to the transfer clutch torque. Then, the drive force distributed to the output shaft 35 is transmitted to a rear differential via a propeller shaft (both not shown) spline fitted on the rear end of the output shaft 35. Here, the clutch accommodating compartment 12 for accommodating the hydraulic multi-plate clutch 8 is partitioned and formed on the axial center of the output shaft 35 on the engine 1 side ahead of the second gear 33. The distal ends of the gear shaft 33a and the output shaft 35 extend into this clutch accommodating compartment 12. A pair of oil seals 36, 36 are held in the transfer case 9 and a housing supporting the gears 32, 33. The pair of oil seals 36, 36 are brought into slidable contact with the gear shaft 33a at an intermediate position along the length thereof. These oil seals 36, 36 are provided in parallel with each other in such a manner that their sealing directions are opposite to each other, whereby the oil-tightness between the gear accommodating compartment 11 and the clutch accommodating compartment 12 is ensured. In the clutch accommodating compartment 12, a clutch hub 37 of the hydraulic multi-plate clutch 8 is fixedly provided on the gear shaft 33a. A clutch drum 38 is fixedly provided on the output shaft 35. A plurality of drive plates 39 are fitted on the outer circumference of the clutch hub 37. A plurality of driven plates 40 are fitted in the clutch drum 38. Both of the plurality of drive plates 39 and the plurality of driven plates 40 are disposed alternately between the clutch hub 37 and the clutch drum 38. In addition, a clutch piston 41 is disposed on one end of the drive plates 39 and the driven plates 40 (on the engine 1 side) whereas a retaining plate (not shown) is disposed on the other end thereof (on the second gear 33 side). Then, the clutch piston 41 slidably contacts the clutch drum 38 and the output shaft 35. A front side gap surrounded by the clutch piston 41 and the clutch drum 38 is formed as an oil pressure compartment 42. In addition, a retainer 43 is provided in such a manner as to confront the clutch piston 41, and is held on the output shaft 35. A return spring 44 is interposed between the retainer 43 and the clutch piston 41, whereby the clutch piston 41 is biased forward by means of this return spring 44. An opening is formed in a right side portion of the clutch accommodating compartment 12, i.e., a substantially horizontal side position of the hydraulic multi-plate clutch 8. The oil pressure control mechanism portion 50 is coupled to close this opening portion. The oil pressure control mechanism portion 50 is adapted to supply the oil pressure of hydraulic fluid to the hydraulic multi-plate clutch 8. The oil pressure control mechanism portion 50 comprises an oil pressure control portion 51 constituted mainly by an oil pressure control valve and oil paths, an oil pump 52 and an electric pump motor 53 which act as an oil pressure source for generating hydraulic oil pressure to be applied to the hydraulic multi-plate 8 and an accumulator 54 for smoothing the hydraulic oil pressure for the hydraulic multi-plate clutch 8 to prevent pulsations. The oil pressure control portion 51 comprises a pressure regulator valve 51a for regulating the oil pressure supplied by the oil pump 52 to an optimum pressure (line pressure) according to the driving conditions. The oil pressure control portion 51 comprises a control valve (a linear solenoid valve) 51b interposed along an oil path for providing a communication between the pressure regulator valve 51a and the oil pressure compartment 42 in the hydraulic multi-plate clutch 8 for variably controlling the oil pressure to the oil pressure compartment 42, i.e., the hydraulic oil pressure for the hydraulic multi-plate clutch 8 based on an output signal from the drive force distribution control portion 70 (see FIG. 3). In addition, a spherical diaphragm type accumulator 54 which is integrally fixed to a right side of the oil pressure control portion 51 is connected to a position along an oil path for connecting the pressure regulator valve 51a to the linear solenoid valve 51b. Furthermore, the oil pump 52 is constituted as, for example, an internal gear pump. A motor shaft (not shown) of the electric pump motor 53 integrally fixed to the oil pressure control portion 51 from the right side thereof protrudes into a pump casing 52a carved in the oil pressure control portion 51 and a pump gear 52b is rotatably attached to the motor shaft. Note that the positional relationship between the accumulator 54 fixed to the oil pressure control portion 51 and the electric pump motor 53 is, as shown by alternate long and short dash lines in FIG. 2, such that the accumulator 54 is located at a diagonally upward and rearward position relative to the electric pump motor 53. Thus, the productivity and serviceability for maintenance of the apparatus can be improved by providing the oil pump 52 in the oil pressure control portion 51 and attaching the electric pump motor 53 and the accumulator to thereby integrally assemble them as the oil pressure control mechanism portion 50. In addition, the overall length of the oil path can be reduced to thereby facilitate the formation of the oil path and provide a simple construction, whereby the design period can be reduced and the production costs can be lowered. Furthermore, since the transmission 2 side and the oil pressure control mechanism portion 50 are constructed to be independent from each other completely, the oil-tightness can easily be secured between the transmission 2 side and the oil pressure control mechanism 50 side. In addition, since the transmission 2 and the oil pressure control mechanism portion 50 are constructed to be independent from each other completely, the apparatus can be applied to various types of transmissions (a manual transmission, an automatic transmission, a continuously variable transmission, or the like) and hence provides wide versatility. Next, a specific example of the control of the hydraulic multi-plate clutch 8 according to the present invention will be described with reference to FIG. 3. Output signals (transfer clutch torque signals) to the oil pressure control mechanism portion 50 for supplying the hydraulic oil pressure to the hydraulic multi-plate clutch 8 are designed to be set at the drive force distribution control portion 70. Sensors and the like are provided on the vehicle for detecting parameters required to set the transfer clutch torque. The sensors and the like are connected to the drive force distribution control portion 70. To be specific, the wheel speeds .omega.fl, .omega.fr, .omega.rl, .omega.rr of the four wheels are detected by wheel speed sensors 61fl, 61fr, 61rl, 61rr. The steering angle .theta. H is detected by a steering angle sensor 62. The yaw rate .gamma. is detected by a yaw rate sensor 63. These values detected are then inputted into the drive force distribution control portion 70. Engine speed Ne and engine output torque Te is derived from an engine control unit 64 for performing various types of controls including fuel injection control. Turbine speed Nt and a gear ratio i is derived from a transmission control unit 65 for executing the change-speed control of an automatic transmission. Then, these values are inputted into the drive force distribution control portion 70. A torque sensing torque Tt, a differential rotation sensing torque Ts and a yaw rate feedback torque Ty are set based on the parameters so inputted at setting units 72, 73, 74 in the drive force distribution control portion 70. Then, these set torques are inputted in a transfer clutch torque setting unit 75, whereby a transfer clutch torque Ttr is set. Thus, according to the present invention, the transfer clutch torque Ttr is set by the torque sensing torque Tt, the differential rotation torque Ts and the yaw rate feedback torque Ty. The clamping force of the hydraulic multi-clutch plate 8 is controlled optimally in accordance with the running conditions and driving conditions of the vehicle. In the drive force distribution apparatus for a four-wheel drive according to the present invention, in the drive force distribution control portion 70, firstly, a transmission output torque To is calculated at a transmission output torque calculating unit 71. A torque sensing torque Tt is calculated by at the torque sensing torque setting unit 72. A differential rotation sensing torque Ts is calculated by at the differential rotation sensing torque setting unit 73. In addition, a yaw rate feedback torque Ty is calculated at the yaw rate feedback torque setting unit 74. Then, a transfer clutch torque Ttr is calculated and set based on the torque sensing torque Tt, the differential rotation sensing torque Ts and the yaw rate feedback torque Ty by at a transfer torque clutch setting unit 75 . The transfer clutch torque calculated and set is then outputted to the oil pressure control mechanism portion 50. In the oil pressure control mechanism portion 50, oil pressure generated by both of the electric pump motor 53 and the oil pump 52 is regulated to an optimum line pressure according to the driving conditions by the pressure regulator valve 51a and is then applied to the linear solenoid valve 51b. Then, when a transfer clutch torque Ttr signal is outputted from the drive force distribution control portion 70 to the linear solenoid valve 51b, the linear solenoid valve 51b is actuated to vary the oil pressure in the oil pressure compartment 42 in the hydraulic multi-plate clutch 8 according to the transfer clutch torque Ttr. The clamping force of the hydraulic multi-plate clutch 8 is varied by the clutch piston 41. Here, the hydraulic oil pressure to the hydraulic multi-plate clutch 8 is smoothed by the accumulator 54 to thereby prevent pulsations. On the other hand, the drive force is changed to the predetermined speed, when it is transmitted from the engine 1 to the transmission 2 and is then transmitted from the output shaft 15 of the transmission 2 to the differential case 6 via the final gear 17. The drive force is then transmitted to the left and right front wheels via the pinion shaft 20, the differential pinions 21, 21, the side gears 22L, 22R and the drive shafts 25L, 25R. In addition, the drive force transmitted to the differential case 6 is then transmitted to the tube portion 26R, and the drive force transmitted to this tube portion 26R is then transmitted to the transfer shaft 34. The drive force transmitted to the transfer shaft 34 is turned in a 90 degree angle to the rear via the first and second direction changing gears 30, 31, and is thereafter transmitted to the pinion shaft 31a. Furthermore, the drive force transmitted to the pinion shaft 31a is turned to the right in a parallel via the first and second gears 32, 33, and is thereafter transmitted to the gear shaft 33a. Then, the drive force transmitted to the gear shaft 33a is variably (for example, the front and rear distribution ratio is varied between 100:0 and 50:50) distributed to the output shaft 35 according to the clamping force of the hydraulic multi-clutch 8 set as described above, and is then transmitted to the rear wheel side via the propeller shaft, not shown. Thus, according to the present invention, the axial center of the pinion shaft 31a for transmitting the drive force, which is turned by the first and second direction changing gears 30, 31 to the rear wheel side, is changed to the parallel position via the first and second gears 32, 33. The hydraulic multi-plate clutch 8 is disposed on the changed axial center of the second gear 33 in the gap closer to the engine 1 side than the second gear 33, whereby the enlargement of the transfer unit 3 can be prevented. Namely, the hydraulic multi-plate clutch 8 can be disposed in the gap between the engine 1 and the gear mechanism portion 7 by displacing the axial center of the pinion shaft 31a in parallel via the first and second gears 32, 33. Accordingly there is no need to dispose the hydraulic multi-plate clutch 8 on the axial center of the front wheel drive shafts 25L, 25R or the axial center of the pinion shaft 31a. Consequently, the transfer unit 3 can be constructed compact and moreover the vertical height position of the output shaft 35 can be set to an optional height, thereby providing good vehicle mounting properties. In particular, since there is no need to dispose the hydraulic multi-plate clutch 8 on the axial center of the pinion shaft 31a, the hydraulic multi-plate clutch 8 is prevented from running across the steering gearbox and the cross member which are disposed transversely at the front of the vehicle body thereabove or therebelow. Therefore good vehicle mounting properties can be provided. In other words, good relative positional relationship can be secured between the steering gearbox and the cross member and the hydraulic multi-plate clutch 8 without re-locating the steering gearbox and curving the cross member. Therefore, the crash safety can be easily ensured with the simple vehicle construction. In addition, since there is no need to run the hydraulic multi-plate clutch 8 across the steering gearbox and the cross member, the space within the passenger compartment and the minimum road clearance can be secured maintained. Additionally, the productivity and serviceability for maintenance of the apparatus can be improved by providing the oil pump 52 in the oil pressure control portion 51 and attaching the electric pump motor 53 and the accumulator to thereby integrally assemble them as the oil pressure control mechanism portion 50. In addition, the overall length of the oil path can also be reduced to thereby facilitate the formation of the oil path and provide a simple construction, whereby the design period can be reduced and the production costs can be lowered. Furthermore, since the transmission 2 side and the oil pressure control mechanism portion 50 are constructed to be independent from each other completely, oil-tightness can easily be secured between oil on the transmission 2 side and oil on the oil pressure control mechanism 50 side. In addition, since the transmission 2 side and the oil pressure control mechanism portion 50 are independent from each other completely, the apparatus can be applied to various types of transmissions (a manual transmission, an automatic transmission, a continuously variable transmission or the like) and hence, provides wide versatility. While in the embodiment of the present invention, the example has been described in which the axial center of the output shaft 35 is displaced to the right via the pair of gears 32, 33, the present invention is not limited thereto and the axial center of the output shaft 35 may be changed or displaced to any position around the circumference of the pinion shaft 31a. Namely, the axial center of the output shaft 35 may be displaced upwardly or downwardly according to variations of the vehicle body structure, as well as positions of the steering gearbox and the like. As has been described heretofore, according to the present invention, superior advantages are provided that the apparatus can be made compact and hence is subject to little positional limitation relative to the vehicle body structure such as the steering gearbox and the cross member, that the oil-tightness of hydraulic oil for operating the hydraulic multi-plate clutch can easily be secured, that the superior productivity of the transmission and transfer unit and serviceability thereof for maintenance after they are installed can be provided and that the good mounting properties can be provided. * * * * *",

Description BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a driving force distributing apparatus for a four-wheel drive vehicle that is capable of automatically canceling an initial torque given by a pressure type differential limiting clutch at a predetermined running speed. Since a four-wheel drive vehicle is excellent in rough road running property, and also in acceleration property and running stability on ordinary roads, it has rapidly become popular. Direct connection between front and rear wheels can realize a good driving system of the four-wheel drive vehicle. However, in such a state, while there is a merit that a strong four-wheel driving state can be attained, there is a disadvantage that the turning performance becomes poor. Namely, a difference in rotational speed generated between the front and rear wheels at the time of a turning can not be absorbed, and so-called tight corner braking phenomena occur. Accordingly, in the four-wheel drive vehicle put to practical use, a suitable driving force distribution device is provided between front and rear wheel transmission shafts. Namely, the front and rear wheels are coupled through the driving force distribution device in the state where a predetermined differential rotation is allowed. As the driving force distribution device, a center differential, a torque coupling, or the like is often adopted. A viscous coupling or a multiple disk clutch is used as the torque coupling. Further, as the torque coupling, there is a torque coupling of a so-called hydraulic type. In the torque coupling of the hydraulic type, a hydraulic pump is provided in a casing that is interlocked and rotated with a transmission shaft connected to one of front and rear wheels, and a rotor that is accommodated in the casing and is interlocked and rotated with a transmission shaft to the other. However, when the driving force distribution device is provided between the front and rear wheel drive shafts, a slip becomes apt to occur at one of the front and rear wheels at the time of running on a rough road such as a low .mu. road (in other words, a road having low friction coefficient). Accordingly, the traction control becomes difficult as compared with a direct coupling four-wheel drive vehicle at that time. Thus, in many cases, the driving force distribution device is preferable to provide with a differential limiting device. In the differential limiting device, an initial torque at such a level that the tight corner breaking phenomenon can be allowed is added between the front and rear wheel transmission shafts. For example, in Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No. Hei. 10-44802, a multiple disk clutch is adopted as a differential limiting device. An initial torque is generated by a hydraulic pressure, a load of a coned disk spring for pressing the multiple disk clutch, to thereby obtain a differential limiting torque at the time of start. It is preferable to give a differential limiting torque to front and rear transmission shafts to improve vehicular starting performance. On the other hand, in the conventional structure in which the initial torque is generated by the multiple-disk clutch using friction engagement elements and the coned-disk spring that applies a load to the friction engagement elements, the initial torque is always generated between the front and rear transmission shafts, even in a region where vehicle speed is high and the initial torque is not needed. This is a problem. Namely, in the case where a differential rotation occurs between the front and rear wheels, the initial torque is generated, so that this initial torque acts as an output loss of a driving system. Accordingly, there are disadvantages that an uncomfortable feeling is given to a driver, and fuel consumption becomes larger. In order to deal with this, for example, Japanese Patent No. 2970913 discloses a technique for actively controlling the intermittent ON-OFF operation of a multiple disk clutch by using a hydraulic pressure. According to the technique recited in this publication, in a region where the initial torque is not needed, the multiple disk clutch is actively disconnected, so that the differential limiting torque can be cancelled. However, in the technique disclosed in this publication, a hydraulic pressure source for operating the multiple disk clutch is always needed, and it can not be easily attached (adapted) to a driving force distribution device without the hydraulic pressure source, and there is a problem that flexible controllability is lacking. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In view of the above, the present invention has an object to provide a driving force distribution device for a four-wheel drive vehicle where a hydraulic pressure source is unnecessary, a differential limiting torque can be actively cancelled, and an uncomfortable feeling is not given to a driver, fuel efficiency is improved, and flexible controllability is excellent. The above-mentioned object can be attained by a driving force distributing apparatus, according to the present invention, comprising: a differential device provided in a vehicle for torque distribution; a differential limiting clutch provided to variably apply a differential limiting torque to limit a differential operation of the differential device; an initial torque applying mechanism provided to apply an initial torque to the differential limiting clutch; and a torque limiter provided to cancel the initial torque at a predetermined vehicle speed. In addition, the above-mentioned object can also be achieved by a driving force distributing apparatus for a four-wheel drive vehicle, according to the present invention, comprising: a center differential device provided distribute a torque from an output shaft of a transmission to a front drive shaft operatively connected to front wheels and a rear drive shaft operatively connected to rear wheels; a differential limiting clutch provided to variably apply a differential limiting torque to limit a differential operation of the center differential device; an initial torque applying mechanism provided to apply an initial torque to the differential limiting clutch; and a torque limiter provided to cancel the initial torque at a predetermined vehicle speed. In the driving force distributing apparatus, it is advantageous that the torque limiter is provided between the front wheel shaft and the rear wheel shaft. In the driving force distributing apparatus, it is preferable that the torque limiter is provided between the output shaft and the front wheel shaft. In the driving force distributing apparatus, the torque limiter may be provided between the output shaft and the rear wheel shaft. Further, the above-mentioned object can also be attained by a driving force distributing apparatus for a four-wheel drive vehicle, according to the present invention, comprising: a center differential device provided to distribute a torque from an output shaft of a transmission to a front drive shaft operatively connected to front wheels and a rear drive shaft operatively connected to rear wheels; a differential limiting clutch provided to variably apply a differential limiting torque to limit a differential operation of the center differential device, the differential limiting clutch having a clutch drum operatively connected to one of the output shaft, the front drive shaft and the rear drive shaft, a clutch hub operatively connected to the other one of the output shaft, the front drive shaft and the rear drive shaft, a plurality of plates interposed between the clutch drum and the clutch hub, and a pressure plate operative to press the plates to engage the clutch drum and the clutch hub; a spring mechanism provided to apply a spring force to the pressure plate to preload the differential limiting, thereby to generate an initial torque; and a torque limiter provided to apply a force opposite to the spring force depending on vehicle speed, to thereby cancel the initial torque at a predetermined vehicle speed. In the driving force distributing apparatus, the spring mechanism may be a cone disk spring. In the driving force distributing apparatus, it is advantageous that the torque limiter comprises a plurality of weights interposed in a space having a triangular-cross-section defined between cam surfaces formed on the clutch hub and the pressure plate, respectively, whereby the weights move in a radius direction depending on vehicle speed and push back the pressure plate against the spring force according to the cam surfaces. Further, in the driving force distributing apparatus, it is more advantageous that the torque limiter further comprises a position plate disposed in the space and having a plurality of pockets formed in a radial direction for supporting movement of corresponding weights. In the above-mentioned driving force distributing apparatus, necessary driving force is transmitted via the differential limiting clutch by the differential limiting torque generated from the initial torque of the differential limiting clutch. On the other hand, at the time of running, when the vehicle speed exceeds the predetermined vehicle run speed, the torque limiter device with the vehicle speed sensor operated by the centrifugal force thereof is activated, and the torque limiter device disconnects the driving force and cancels the initial torque. In this embodiment, preferably, the torque limiter includes pressure surfaces formed between the two shafts or the differentials, a position plate provided between the press surfaces, and a weight provided in a slit-like pocket formed radially therein. In addition, the weight is provided between both the pressure surfaces, and at least one of the press surfaces has a taper shape so as toconver the other pressure surface.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Hereinafter, an embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to the drawings. FIG. 1 is a schematic structural view of a driving force distributing apparatus for a four-wheel drive vehicle. As shown in the drawing, in this embodiment, as a driving system of the four-wheel drive vehicle, a vertical trans-axle type is adopted. In this driving system, provided are a torque converter case 1, a differential case 2, a transmission case 3, an extension case 4 and an oil pan 5. The torque converter case 1 and the differential case 2 are integrally formed at the front. The transmission case 3 is connected to the rear end of the cases 1 and 2. The extension case 4 is connected to the rear side of the transmission case 3. A transmission is provided in the extension case 4. Further, the oil pan 5 is attached to the lower portion of the transmission case 3. Reference numeral 10 designates an engine. A crank shaft 11 of the engine 10 is coupled to the input side of a torque converter 13. The torque converter 13 is disposed inside of the torque converter case 1 and is provided with a lockup clutch 12. Further, a transmission input shaft 14 of an automatic transmission 30 is disposed in the transmission case 3 that is coupled to the output side of the torque converter 13. On the other hand, an output shaft (transmission output shaft) 15 of the automatic transmission 30 is disposed coaxially with the input shaft (transmission input shaft) 14, and the transmission output shaft 15 is coupled to the input side of a center differential device 50 as the transmission disposed in the extension case 4. Further, a front drive shaft 16 as a front wheel transmission shaft and a rear drive shaft 20 as a rear wheel transmission shaft are branched-off from and connected to the output side of the center differential device 50. The front drive shaft 16 is disposed in the transmission case 3 and extended in parallel with the transmission input shaft 14 and the output shaft 15. The rear end of the front drive shaft 16 is coupled to the center differential device 50 through a pair of reduction gears 17 and 18. Further, the front end of the front drive shaft 16 is coupled to a front differential device 19 disposed in the differential case 2. A front wheel output shaft (not shown) connected to front wheels is coupled with the front differential device 19. The rear drive shaft 20 is coupled with a rear wheel output shaft (not shown) for pivotally supporting rear wheels through a propeller shaft 21 and a rear differential device 22. On the other hand, the automatic transmission 30 includes a front planetary gear 31 and a rear planetary gear 32. With respect to the front planetary gear 31 and the rear planetary gear 32, there are provided a high clutch 33, a reverse clutch 34, a brake band 35, a forward clutch 36, an over running clutch 37, a low and reverse clutch 38, and one-way clutches 39 and 40. Accordingly, four forward speeds and one backward speed gear shift can be obtained by selectively engaging them respectively. At the front of the automatic transmission 30, an oil pump 41 is provided to couple and to drive an impeller sleeve 13a of the torque converter and a drive shaft 42, and a control valve body 43 is contained in the oil pan 5. By the control valve body 43, oil is supplied to and discharged from the foregoing respective friction elements, and control of engagement and disengagement is individually made. The center differential device 50 is of a complex planetary gear type. The device 50 comprises a first pinion 52, a first sun gear 51, a second pinion 54, and a second sun gear 53. The first pinion 52 is engaged with a first sun gear 51 provided at the output shaft 15. The second pinion 54 engaged with a second sun gear 53 provided at the rear drive shaft 20. The first and second pinions 52 and 54 are integrally formed. Besides, a carrier 55 for rotatably supporting the pinions 52 and 54 is coupled with the reduction gear 17. When driving force outputted from the output shaft is transmitted to the first pinion 52 through the first sun gear 51, a torque is transmitted at a predetermined distribution ratio to the second sun gear 53 and the reduction gear 17 through the second pinion 54 integrated with the first pinion 52 and the carrier 55. At this time, a difference in rotational speed between those of the second sun gear 53 and the reduction gear 17 is absorbed by the rotational difference of the first and second pinions 52 and 54. Incidentally, in this embodiment, pitch circle radii of the first and second pinions 52 and 54 are set to have larger torque of reference torque distribution to the rear wheel. Besides, the carrier 55 and the rear drive shaft 20 are coupled with each other through a pressure type differential limiting clutch 60. As shown in FIG. 2, a clutch drum 61 of the pressure type differential limiting clutch 60 is coupled to the carrier 55, and to this inner periphery, an outer periphery of a clutch hub 62 rotated integrally with the rear drive shaft 20 is provided to be opposite. Further, a drive plate 63 and a driven plate 64 are alternately disposed therebetween. An outer peripheral surface of a pressure plate 65 is brought into contact with an outside surface of the drive plate 63 disposed at a front side outer end, and a retainer plate 66 is brought into contact with an outside surface of the drive plate 63 disposed at a rear side outer end. The outer peripheries of the driven plate 64, the pressure plate 65, and the retainer plate 66 are engaged in spline grooves formed on the inner periphery of the clutch drum 61 so as to be supported movably in the axial direction. The outside surface of the retainer plate 66 is prevented from falling out by a snap ring 67. Besides, the inner periphery of the drive plate 63 is engaged in a spline groove formed in the outer periphery of the clutch hub 62 and is supported movably in the axial direction. Further, a cone disk spring 68 is provided at the back surface of the pressure plate 65, and the pressure plate 65 is pressed and energized in the direction toward the retainer plate 66 by energizing force of the cone disk spring 68. A friction torque (initial torque) is generated between the drive plate 63 and the driven plate 64 by the pressure plate 65 moved by receiving the energizing force of the cone disk spring 68, and this initial torque becomes a differential limiting torque when the center differential device 50 enters into differential rotation. Incidentally, as a place at which the differential limiting torque is generated, there are conceivable three examples as follows. (1) a place between the input side and one of output sides (e.g., a place between the automatic transmission output shaft 15 and a front drive shaft 16); (2) a place between the input side and the other of output sides (e.g., a place between the automatic transmission output shaft 15 and a rear drive shaft 20); and (3) a place between the output sides (e.g., a place between the front drive shaft 16 and a rear drive shaft 20). When it is generated between both the output sides as in this embodiment, it is the most effective, because torque transfer can be directly made from the one of output sides to the other of the output sides. Besides, a torque limiter device 70 with a vehicle speed sensor is provided in the center differential device 50. The torque limiter device 70 cancels the initial torque of the pressure type differential limiting clutch 60 when a vehicle speed exceeds a predetermined speed. As shown in FIG. 2, a front cam surface 65a and a rear cam surface 62a as press surfaces opposed each other in a thrust direction are formed on the inner periphery of the pressure plate 65 and the outer periphery of the clutch hub 62. Further, a base surface 62b continuous with the rear cam surface 62a is formed on the clutch hub 62. A ring-shaped space portion 73 having a triangular-cross-section converging in a radius direction with an inclined angle of angle .theta. (see FIG. 4) is formed by both the cam surfaces 62a and 65a and the base surface 62b. Further, a position plate 71 is disposed in a spaced portion 73. Since the inner periphery of the position plate 71 is spline-engaged with the base surface 62b, it is rotated integrally with the clutch hub 62. However, as a modified example, the outer periphery of the position plate 71 may be spline-engaged with the pressure plate 65 so that it is rotated integrally with the pressure plate 65. Besides, as shown in FIG. 3, a plurality of pockets 71a are radially formed in the position plate 71, and a weight 72 formed into a ball shape is movably supported in each of the pockets 71a. This weight 72 is provided in the spaced portion 73 in the state where its movement in the circumferential direction is restricted by the pocket 71a and its movement in the radius direction is allowed. When the clutch hub 62 is stopped, it is in a free state. When centrifugal force is given by the rotation of the clutch hub 62, it is moved in the radius direction, and then both side surfaces of the weight 72 press the respective cam surfaces 65a and 62a. Next, the operation of the embodiment according to the above structure will be described. First, the driving force of the engine 10 is inputted to the transmission input shaft 14 of the automatic transmission 30 through the torque converter 13, and speed-changed driving force changed to a predetermined speed by the automatic transmission 30 is inputted from the transmission output shaft 15 to the first sun gear 51 of the center differential device 50. The torque outputted from the transmission output shaft 15 is distributed to the rear drive shaft 20 and the front drive shaft 16 through the center differential device 50, because of that: (i) the first pinion 52 engaging with the first sun gear 51 and the second pinion 54 engaging with the second sun gear 53 that is provided at the rear drive shaft 20 are integrally formed, and (ii) the reduction gear 18 provided at the front drive shaft 16 is engaged with the reduction gear 17 provided at the carrier 55 supporting the pinions 52 and 54. The torque distributed to the rear drive shaft 20 is further transmitted through the propeller shaft 21 and the rear differential device 22 to the rear wheel output shaft (not shown) connecting to the rear wheels. On the other hand, the torque distributed to the front drive shaft 16 is further transmitted through the front differential device 19 to the front wheel output shaft (not shown) of the front wheel. Accordingly, four-wheel drive running can be achieved. The initial torque, set by the pressure force of the cone disk spring 68, of the pressure type differential limiting clutch 60 acts as the differential limiting torque, in a case of at least one of following situations: (i) when departing from a rough road, (ii) at running on a low .mu. road (i.e, a road having a low friction coefficient), or (iii) at a state where one wheel is floating, (iv) at a time when differential rotation between the front and rear transmission shafts occurs, (v) during the occurrence of the differential rotation. The reference torque distribution of the center differential device 50 of the embodiment is set so that much torque is distributed to the rear wheel. When the rear wheel slips before the front wheel, a small amount of the torque outputted to the rear drive shaft 20 at that time is transmitted to the front drive shaft 16 through the pressure type differential limiting clutch 60, and the torque of the rear wheel is reduced by this, and the occurrence of slip disappears. At that time, in the pressure type differential limiting clutch 60, the cone disk spring 68 presses the drive plate 63 and the driven plate 64 provided between the pressure plate 65 and the retainer plate 66, and the friction force (initial force) acts as the differential limiting torque. On the other hand, at high speed running, the torque limiter device 70 is activated, and the initial torque of the pressure type differential limiting clutch 60 is cancelled. That is, at the high speed running, the weight 72 supported by the pocket 71a formed in the position plate 71 rotated integrally with the rear drive shaft 20 receives centrifugal force and is moved in the radius direction, intrudes between the cam surfaces 65a and 62a, and presses both the cam surfaces 65a and 62a. When the pressure force of the weight 72 to the respective cam surfaces 65a and 62a exceeds the pressure force of the cone disk spring 68, the weight 72 pushes and extends an interval between the cam surfaces 65a and 62a, the pressure plate 65 forming the cam surface 65a moves back against the press force of the cone disk spring 68, the pressure between the drive plate 63 and the driven plate 64 is relieved, and the initial torque is cancelled. Like this, in a high speed region in which the differential limiting torque is not needed, the initial torque of the torque limiter device 70 which performs a differential limiting torque is actively cancelled, so that running stability is improved, and torque loss is reduced, and consequently, fuel efficiency can be improved. Incidentally, as shown in FIG. 4, a thrust force F acting on the cam surfaces 65a and 62a by the centrifugal force through the weight 72 can be obtained from the following expression. Here, .theta. is a taper angle of the cam surface, .mu. is a friction coefficient, m is mass of the weight, n is the number of the weights, and r' is a designated radius. When the thrust force F exceeds the thrust force acting on the cam surface 65 by the energizing force of the cone disk spring 68, the pressure plate 65 moves back, and the differential limiting torque is cancelled. Incidentally, the above formula can be rewritten from FIG. 4 and from the formula: .omega.=(2.pi./60)N. Incidentally, the symbol r in FIG. 4 designates an arbitrary radius. Accordingly, it becomes possible to cancel the differential limiting torque in a desired speed region by suitably setting the mass m of the weight 72, the number n, the designated radius r', and the taper angle .theta. of the cam surface 65a. Like this, according to the embodiment, at a predetermined vehicle speed or higher at which the differential limiting torque becomes unnecessary, the initial torque of torque limiter device 70 is actively cancelled, so that the running stability is improved, and the fuel efficiency is improved by the reduction of torque loss. Further, since a hydraulic pressure source is not needed, it can be relatively easily attached to a driving force distribution device which is not originally provided with a hydraulic pressure source, such as a torque coupling, and is excellently adding flexible controllability. In addition, the strength of the driving system can be lowered by reducing the torque loss, and as a result, the weight becomes light, and the fuel efficiency can be further improved therethrough. Incidentally, the present invention is not limited to the foregoing embodiment, but for example, the torque limiter device 70 may be provided between differential motion generating mechanism portions of a torque coupling. Besides, one of the cam surfaces 62a and 65a may be formed to vertically extend in a circumferential direction. Further, for example, the weight 72 is not limited to the ball shape, but as long as it is moved in the circumferential direction by centrifugal force and presses the cam surface, for example, a roller-shaped one may be adopted. While there has been described in connection with the preferred embodiment of the invention, various changes and modifications may be made therein without departing from the invention, and it is aimed, therefore, to cover in the appended claim all such changes and modifications as fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention. As described above, according to the present invention, since the differential limiting torque is cancelled by using the centrifugal force, the hydraulic pressure source is not needed. Therefore, it can be relatively easily attached to the driving force distribution device which is not provided with a hydraulic pressure source, and is excellently performs a flexible controllability. Besides, in a region where the differential limiting torque is not needed, the differential limiting torque is actively cancelled, so that the torque loss is reduced, and running stability is improved, and further, the fuel efficiency can be improved. * * * * *",

            "fullText":"  ( 1 of 1 ) United States Patent 6,554,735 Kanazawa April 29, 2003 Planetary gear type differential apparatus Abstract A sliding surface is formed on an inner periphery of a drum member secured to a rear output shaft of a differential limiting device. There is provided a cam member between a projection and the sliding surface. The cam member has a friction surface slidable on the sliding surface and a V-shaped groove engageable with the projection. When a relative rotation occurs between the drum member and the carrier, the position where the projection is engaged with the V-shaped groove deviates so as to press the cam member toward the sliding surface. As a result, due to a frictional resistance of the friction surface against the sliding surface, first a differential limiting occurs between the drum member and the carrier and then a differential is locked up by a wedge effect of a corner edge of the cam member.

Description BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a differential locking or limiting apparatus of a planetary gear type differential for locking up a differential between a carrier and a shaft member provided with a sun gear. A variety of differential locking apparatuses in which two of input and output shafts can be locked up with each other have been proposed to date. Generally, these differential locking apparatuses are constituted by a multiple disc clutch provided between two of input and output shafts and a differential limiting mechanism for pressing the multiple disc clutch when a differential rotation generates between these two shafts. For example, Japanese Paten Unexamined Publication No. Hei. 1-278841 discloses a differential locking apparatus of a planetary gear type center differential comprising a multiple disc clutch provided between front and rear wheels and a ball cam for pressing the multiple disc clutch when a differential rotation generates between the front and rear wheels. However, the differential locking apparatus having the multiple disc clutch and the differential limiting mechanism incurs a complication of the apparatus and an up-sizing of the apparatus. Particularly since the multiple disc clutch is constituted by a plurality of drive and driven plates arranged in the axial direction, the up-sizing in the axial direction is noticeable. Further, conventionally, a differential is provided with a differential limiting apparatus which adds a differential limiting torque as an initial torque in advance, or bypasses and transmits a torque to the other output shaft when one output shaft slips. This sort of differential limiting apparatus is generally constituted by a hydraulic multiple disk clutch, and for example, Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No. Hei. 5-112149 discloses a technique in which in a planetary gear center differential, a hydraulic multiple disk clutch is provided between a carrier and a rear drive shaft, and a differential limiting torque is generated in the hydraulic multiple disk clutch in accordance with a rear wheel slip. However, since the hydraulic multiple disk clutch is generally constituted in such a manner that a plurality of drive plates and driven plates are arranged, there is a fear that a device becomes complicated and large-sized. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is an object of the present invention to provide a differential locking or limiting apparatus for a planetary gear type differential having a small size and simple structure. In order to attain the object, a planetary gear type differential apparatus provided on a shaft member and having a carrier rotatably mounted on said shaft member, a sun gear secured on the shaft, a pinion meshing with the sun gear, and a pinion shaft secured to the carrier for rotatably supporting the pinion. The differential apparatus comprises a sliding surface provided on the shaft, a projection formed at an end portion of the pinion-shaft and projected from an end surface of the carrier, and a cam member including a friction surface slidable on the sliding surface and a V-shaped groove engageable with the projection and provided between the sliding surface and the projection. That is, according to the invention, when a differential occurs between the shaft member and the carrier, the cam member relatively moves with respect to the carrier by frictional resistance of the friction surface against the sliding surface and the position where the projection is engaged with the V-shaped groove deviates. According to the deviation amount of the projection with respect to the groove, a pressure toward the sliding surface generates in the cam member and the frictional resistance of the friction surface against the sliding surface is increased to perform a differential between the shaft member and the carrier. When the amount of the positional deviation of the projection with respect to the V-shaped groove further increases, the relationship between the shaft and the carrier is locked due to the wedge effect of the friction surface. In addition to this, the above-mentioned object can be achieved by a planetary gear type differential apparatus provided on a shaft member and having a carrier rotatably mounted on said shaft member, a sun gear provided at the shaft portion, a pinion engaged with the sun gear, and a pinion shaft for rotatably supporting the pinion to the carrier, the differential apparatus according to the present invention comprising: an annular sliding portion provided on the shaft member; a projection formed by protruding an end portion of the pinion shaft from an end surface of the carrier; a cam member disposed between the sliding portion and the projection, the cam member including a friction surface that is slidably engaged with the sliding portion and a V-shaped groove that is engageable with the projection; and a pair of restriction sections which are formed at an end surface of the carrier and disposed at both sides of the cam member, each of the restriction sections regulating the movement of the cam member in a rotational direction of the carrier while a predetermined swing motion is permitted. According to the invention, when a differential movement is occurred between the shaft member and the carrier, the cam member is moved relatively to the carrier between the restriction sections by friction resistance of the friction surface with respect to the sliding portion. At that time, an engagement position of the V-shaped groove with respect to the projection is shifted. In accordance with the shifting amount of the engagement position of the V-shaped groove relative to the projection, a press force in the direction toward the sliding portion is generated at the cam member, and the friction resistance of the friction surface with respect to the sliding portion is increased. Therefore, a differential limitation is made between the shaft portion and the carrier. With this structure, the cam member is positioned at the inner periphery of the sliding portion, and the press force by a centrifugal force in the direction toward the sliding portion is applied to the cam member. In the above-mentioned structure, it is preferable that the shaft member comprises: a shaft; and a drum member fixed to the shaft and having an inner periphery on which the sliding portion is formed. In the above-mentioned structure, it is preferable that the shaft member comprises: a shaft having an outer periphery on which the sliding portion is formed. Further, in the above-mentioned structure, it is also preferable that the shaft member comprises: a shaft; and a ring member coupled with the shaft and having an outer periphery on which sliding portion is formed. With the structure, the cam member is positioned at the outer periphery of the sliding portion, and a force to cancel the press force in the direction toward the sliding portion by a centrifugal force is applied to the cam member. Moreover, in the above-mentioned structure, it is advantageous to further comprise an energizing member urging the cam member towards the sliding portion. With this structure, an initial torque in the planetary gear type differential can be generated.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Referring now to FIGS. 1 and 2, reference numeral 1 denotes an engine disposed in a front portion of a vehicle and reference numeral 2 denotes a manual transmission connected to a rear part of the engine 1. Behind a clutch housing 3 of the manual transmission 2, a transmission case 4 is formed integrally with the clutch housing 3. Further, a transfer case 5 is connected with a rear part of the transmission case 4. Further, an extension case 6 is connected with a rear part of the transfer case 5. The clutch housing 3 includes a starting clutch 7, the transmission case 4 includes a final reduction gear unit 8 and a manual transmission 9 and the transfer case 5 includes a transfer section 10. A crankshaft 11 of the engine 1 is connected with the starting clutch 7 and the starting clutch 7 is connected with an input shaft 21 of the manual transmission 9. The manual transmission 9 has a hollow counter shaft 22 provided in parallel with the input shaft 21 and a 1.sup.st gear train 23, a 2.sup.nd gear train 24, a 3.sup.rd gear train 25 and a 4.sup.th gear train 26 are arranged in this order between the input shaft 21 and the counter shaft 22. A synchromesh mechanisms 30 is provided between the 1.sup.st gear train 23 and the 2.sup.nd gear train 24 and a synchromesh mechanism 31 is provided between the 3.sup.rd gear train 25 and the 4.sup.th gear train 26, respectively. Further, a reverse gear train 28 is disposed between the 1.sup.st gear train 23 and the 2.sup.nd gear train 24. Further, the input shaft 21 and counter shaft 22 extends inside of the transfer case 5 in which a 5.sup.th gear train 27 and synchromesh mechanism 32 are disposed between these two shafts. Thus, the manual transmission 9 is constituted so as to be shifted to any one of five forward speed gears by selectively actuating those three synchromesh mechanisms 30, 31 and 32 and to be shifted to a reverse position by engaging the reverse gear train 28. In the transfer case 5, a planetary gear type center differential 35 is disposed on the counter shaft 22. The center differential 35 is driveably (functionally) connected with a front drive shaft 36 disposed in the counter shaft 22 and also driveably connected with a rear drive shaft 37 disposed on the same axis as the input shaft 21 through a transfer gear train 38 so as to distribute a shifted power inputted from the counter shaft 22 between both drive shafts 36, 37. Further, the power transmitted to the front drive shaft 36 is transmitted to the final reduction gear unit 8 of front wheels and on the other hand the power transmitted to the rear drive shaft 37 is transmitted to a final reduction gear unit 40 of rear wheels through a propeller shaft 39. Further, a differential locking apparatus 41 is incorporated in the rear of the center differential 35 so as to be able to connect the front wheels with rear wheels. Next, the center differential 35 according to the present invention will be described in detail by reference to FIG. 1. The center differential 35 includes a hollow center differential input shaft 51 spline-fitted at an end portion thereof to the outer periphery of the counter shaft 22 through an intermediate member 50, a hollow front output shaft 55 spline-fitted at an end portion thereof over the outer periphery of the hollow front output shaft 55 through a intermediate member 54 and a rear output shaft 57 fitted at an end portion thereof to the front output shaft 55. These shafts 51, 55 and 57 are in a rotatable relationship with each other. A first sun gear 60 having a large diameter is formed integrally with the center differential input shaft 51 at the other end thereof and a plurality of first pinions 61 meshes with the first sun gear 60. In this embodiment, three first pinions 61 are arranged around the first sun gear 60 at an equal interval. Also, a second sun gear 63 having a small diameter is spline-fitted to the rear output shaft 57 and a plurality of second pinions 64 having a large diameter mesh with the second sun gear 63 therearound. In this embodiment, three second pinions 64 are arranged around the second sun gear 63 at an equal interval. The first pinion 61 and the second pinion 64 are formed integrally on a pinion member 65, forming a pair of the first and second pinions 61, 64. In this embodiment, three pairs of the first and second pinions 61, 64 are formed on the pinion member 65. The pinion member 65 is rotatably supported by a pinion shaft 67 secured to a carrier 66. That is, the center differential input shaft 51 is rotatably fitted to the carrier 66 from the front and the rear output shaft 57 is rotatably fitted to the carrier 66 from the rear. The first sun gear 60 and the second sun gear 63 are accommodated in a space enclosed by the carrier 66. Further, the pinion shaft 67 is provided across the front and rear part of the carrier 66 in such a manner that the first pinion 61 meshes with the first sun gear 60 and the second pinion 64 meshes with the second sun gear 63. The rear end of the front output shaft 55 is projected into the carrier 66. A hub 70 secured to the inner periphery of the carrier 66 extends inwardly through a space between the first and second sun gears 60, 63 and is spline-fitted over the front output shaft 55 at the rear end thereof. Further, the power transmitted from the pinion member 65 to the carrier 66 through the pinion shaft 67 is transmitted to the front drive shaft 36 through the hub 70 and the front output shaft 55. On the other hand, a transfer drive gear 38a is integrally formed with the rear output shaft 57 at the rear thereof. Further, a transfer drive gear 38b meshing with the transfer drive gear 38a is integrally formed with the rear drive shaft 37, constituting a transfer gear train 38. The power transmitted to the rear output shaft 57 through the second sun gear 63 is transmitted to the rear drive shaft 37 through the transfer gear train 38, after being shifted by the transmission. As shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, the differential locking apparatus 41 has a drum member 42 spline-fitted at the rear of the center differential 35 over the rear output shaft 57. The drum member 42 has a sliding surface 42a shaped in a partial arc on an inner periphery surface of the drum member 42 and enclosed by restriction sections 45, 45. An end portion of the pinion shaft 67 projects from the rear end surface of the carrier 66 supporting the pinion shaft 67 and this projection 67a is opposite to the sliding surface 42a in the drum member 42. Further, there is provided a cam member 43 between the sliding surface 42a and the projection 67a. The cam member 43 has a friction surface 43a shaped in a partial arc which is slidable on the sliding surface 42a and a V-shaped groove 43b which is engageable with the projection 67a. Since the friction surface 43a abuts against the sliding surface 42a and the projection 67a is engaged with the V-shaped groove 43b, the cam member 43 is supported between the sliding surface 42a and the projection 67a. Further, when a relative rotation occurs between the drum member 42 and the carrier 66, the cam member 43 makes a relative movement with respect to the carrier 66. Then, one corner edge of the friction surface 43a rises and the other corner edge sinks. As a result, in accordance with a deviation amount of an engagement position of the V-shaped groove 43b with respect to the projection 67a, pressure toward the sliding surface 42a generates in the direction of the cam member 43 and a frictional resistance of the friction surface 43a against the sliding surface 42a increases. As a result, a differential limiting is performed between the rear output shaft 57 and the carrier 66. Furthermore, when the relative rotation continues between the drum member 42 and the carrier 66, the cam member 43 locks a differential between the output shaft 57 and the carrier 66 due to a wedge effect of the one corner edge of the friction surface 43a. The friction surface 43a is formed by coating or bonding friction material on the cam member 43. Next, an operation of thus constituted manual transmission 2 will be described. First, when the gear is shifted to a forward position after the starting clutch 7 is disengaged, one of the gear trains 23, 24, 25, 26 and 27 corresponding to the 1.sup.st, 2.sup.nd, 3.sup.rd, 4.sup.th and 5.sup.th speed ratios respectively is selected while it synchronizes with the input shaft 21 by the help of the synchromesh mechanisms 30, 31 or 32. When the starting clutch 7 is engaged, the power of the engine 1 is inputted to the input shaft 21 of the manual transmission 9 and the power shifted by the selected gear trains is outputted to the counter shaft 22. Further, when the gear is shifted to a reverse speed ratio with a starting clutch 7 disengaged, the reverse gear train 28 is selected and reversed power is outputted to the counter shaft 22. Thus, the manual transmission 2 has five forward speed ratios and one reverse speed ratio. The power shifted in the manual transmission 9 is inputted to the sun gear 60 of the center differential 35 and is transmitted to the pinion member 65 through the first pinion 61. The center differential 35 has a torque distribution ratio between the front and rear wheels established to TF:TR=36.4:63.6 by properly selecting gear ratios. Accordingly, the shifted power is distributed and outputted to the carrier 66 by 36.4% and to the second sun gear 63 by 63.6%, respectively. The power transmitted to the carrier 66 is transmitted to the front wheels through the hub 70, the front output shaft 55, the front drive shaft 36 and the final reduction gear unit 8. According to the rear-overdistributed torque distribution ratio of this embodiment, the vehicle has a taste of oversteer and as a result good turning ability and good steering characteristics. Further, when the vehicle makes a turn during driving in a four wheel drive mode, the planetary rotation of the first and second pinions 61, 64 of the center differential 35 allows to absorb the rotational difference between the front and rear wheels which generates when cornering and enables the vehicle to make a smooth turning. In this moment, the second sun gear 63, namely, the drum member 42 has a relative rotation with respect to the carrier 66 and the cam member 43 makes a relative movement with respect to the carrier 66 by a small frictional resistance of the friction surface 43 against the sliding surface 42a. As a result, the engagement position of the V-shaped groove 43b with respect to the projection 67a changes. In accordance with the deviation amount of the engagement position of the V-shaped groove 43a, a pressure toward the sliding surface 42a generates in the cam member 43, the frictional resistance of the friction surface 43a against the sliding surface 42a increases, there occurs a differential limiting between the rear output shaft 57 and the carrier 66. That is, when the cam member 43 makes a relative movement with respect to the carrier 66, the inclined surface of the V-shaped groove 43b is pressed by the projection 67a and the cam member 43 increases the frictional resistance against the drum member 42. Since the cam member 43 is biased toward the sliding surface 42a of the drum member 42 by a centrifugal force corresponding to the revolution number of the carrier 66, the differential limiting torque varies according to revolution number. When the relative rotation of the carrier 66 with respect to the drum member 42 becomes large and the cam member 43 makes a further relative movement with respect to the carrier 66, the cam member 43 locks up the differential between the rear output shaft 57 and the carrier 66 by the wedge effect of the corner edge of the friction surface 43a, as shown in FIG. 2b. Further, even if the cam member 43 does not lock the differential, when the end surface of the cam member 43 contacts the restriction section, the differential locking apparatus 41 enters into a lock-up condition. That is, the differential locking apparatus 41 allows the center differential 35 to have a differential at the maximum within a range corresponding to the sliding interval from one restriction section 45 to the other restriction section 45. Thus, according to the embodiment, the differential locking apparatus 41 is mainly constituted by the projection 67a, that is, the end portion of the pinion shaft 67 projected from the end surface of the carrier 66, and the cam member 43 interlocked with the projection 67a. That is, the differential locking apparatus 41 according to the present invention has a simple construction without using a plurality of clutch discs and accordingly the axial length of the apparatus can be reduced. Further, the characteristics of differential limiting torques, the timing of differential lockings, can be easily changed by changing geometric dimensions of the V-shaped groove 43b. Further, according to the differential locking apparatus 41 of the embodiment, since the differential lock is accomplished by the wedge effect, abrasion to some extent does not have an effect on the differential lock. Further, an allowable maximum range of a differential can be changed by changing the interval between the restriction sections 45 and 45. Further, the overall inner periphery surface of the drum member 42 can be formed into a sliding surface 42a by abolishing the restriction section 45. FIGS. 4 and 5 show a second embodiment of the present invention. In the drawings, reference numeral 71 denotes a differential locking apparatus wherein a ring member 72 is spline-fitted at the rear of the center differential 35 to the rear output shaft 57. A sliding surface 72a shaped in a partial arc and enclosed by restriction sections 75, 75 is formed around the outer periphery of the ring member 72. The ring member 72 may be formed directly on the rear output shaft 57 without being fitted to the rear output shaft 57. Further, an end portion of the pinion shaft 67 is projected from the rear end surface of the carrier 66 for supporting the pinion shaft 67 and a projection 67a of the pinion shaft 67 is opposite to the sliding surface 72a. Further, there is provided a cam member 73 between the sliding surface 72a and the projection 67a. The cam member 73 has a friction surface 73 shaped in a partial arc and slidable on the sliding surface 72a and a V-shaped groove 73b engageable with the projection 67a. Since the friction surface 73a contacts the sliding surface 72a and the projection 67a is engaged with the V-shaped groove 73b, the cam member 73 is held between the sliding surface 72a and the projection 67a. When a relative rotation generates between the ring member 72 and the carrier 66, that is, between the projection 67a and the ring member 72, one corner edge of the cam member 73 is pressed toward the sliding surface 72a according to the deviation amount of the position where the V-shaped groove 73b is engaged with the projection 67a. Then, a frictional resistance between the friction surface 73a and the sliding surface 72a increases and a differential limiting occurs between the rear output shaft 57 and the carrier 66. Further, when the relative rotation between the ring member 72 and the carrier 66 becomes large, the cam member 73 locks up the relative rotation between the ring member 72 and the carrier 66 by the wedge effect of the corner edge of the cam member 73. The friction surface 73a is formed by coating or bonding the cam member 73 with an anti-frictional material. Thus the differential locking apparatus has almost the same effect as the first embodiment. Hereinafter, another embodiments according to the invention will be described with reference to the drawings.

In these drawings, reference numeral 101 designates an engine provided at the front of a vehicle body. Reference numeral 102 indicates a manual transmission coupled with the rear of the engine 101. A transmission case 104 is integrally formed behind a clutch housing 103 of the manual transmission 102. A transfer case 105 is coupled with the rear of the transmission case 104.

The manual gearbox 109 includes a hollow counter shaft 122 parallel to the input shaft 121. In the inside of the transmission case 104, a first-speed gear train 123, a second-speed gear train 124, a third-speed gear train 125, and a fourth-speed gear train 126 are sequentially disposed from the front between the input shaft and the counter shaft 122. Further, synchro mechanisms 130 and 131 are respectively provided between two gears. A reverse gear train 128 is arranged between the first-speed gear 123 and the second-speed gear. The input shaft 121 and the counter shaft 122 are extended into the inside of the transfer case 105, and a fifth-speed gear train 127 and a synchro mechanism 132 are go disposed therebetween. The manual gearbox 109 is constructed in such a manner that the three sets of the synchro mechanisms 130, 131 and 132 are selectively operated to make a shift into any one of the five forward speeds or the reverse gear train 128 is engaged to make the shift into reverse. In the transfer case 105, a planetary gear center differential 135 is disposed coaxially with the counter shaft 122. A front drive shaft 136 disposed in the counter shaft 122 is coupled with the center differential 135. A rear drive shaft 137 disposed coaxially with the input shaft 121 is coupled therewith through a transfer gear train 138. A speed-changed power inputted from the counter shaft 122 is distributed to both the drive shafts 136 and 137. The power transmitted to the front drive shaft 136 is transmitted to the final reduction gear 108 of the front wheel, while the power transmitted to the rear drive shaft 137 is transmitted to a final reduction gear 140 of a rear wheel through a propeller shaft 139. A differential limiting apparatus 141 is provided at the rear of the center differential 135, and makes a differential limitation between the front and rear wheels. Next, the structure of the center differential 135 will be described in detail with reference to FIG. 6. The center differential 135 comprises a hollow center differential input shaft 151, a hollow front output shaft 155, and a rear output shaft 157. The front end side of the hollow center differential input shaft 151 is spline-coupled with the outer periphery of the counter shaft 122 through an intermediate member 150. The hollow front output shaft 155 is disposed in the inside of the center differential input shaft 151, and a tip end side of the hollow front output shaft 155 is spline-coupled with the outer periphery of the front drive shaft 136 through an intermediate member 154. The front end side of the rear output shaft 157 is made to face an inside of the front output shaft 155. The respective shafts 511, 155 and 157 are relatively and coaxially rotatable with each other on the same axis. A large-sized first sun gear 160 is integrally formed at the rear end of the center differential input shaft 151. A plurality of (for example, three) small-sized first pinions 161 is engaged with the first sun gear 160 at equal intervals. Besides, a small-sized sun gear 163 is spline-fitted to the middle of the rear output shaft 157. A plurality of (for example, three) large-sized second pinions 164 is engaged with the second sun gear 163 at equal intervals. In the first and second pinions 161 and 164, the pairs of the first and second pinions 161 and 164 corresponding to each other are integrally formed on pinion members 165, and the respective pinion members 165 are rotatably supported on pinion shafts 167 fixed to a carrier 166. That is, in the carrier 166, the center differential input shaft 151 is rotatably inserted from the front, while the rear output shaft 157 is rotatably inserted from the rear, and the first sun gear 160 and the second sun gear 163 are arranged in a center space. Then, the respective pinion shafts 167 are longitudinally provided so that the respective first pinions 161 can be engaged with the first sun gear 160, and the respective second pinions 164 can be engaged with the second sun gear 163. Here, the first sun gear 160 and the second sun gear 163 are arranged in the inside of the carrier 166 at a predetermined interval, and the rear end side of the front output shaft 155 is made to face the inside of the carrier 166 from a gap between the first and second sun gears 160, 163. A hub 170 is fixed to the inner periphery of the carrier 166, and the hub 170 is extended into the inside of the center differential input shaft 151 from the gap between the first and second sun gears 160 and 163 and is spline-coupled with the outer periphery of the front output shaft 155. Then, the power transmitted to the carrier 166 through the pinion shaft 167 is transmitted to the front drive shaft 136 through the hub 170 and the front output shaft 155. On the other hand, a transfer drive gear 138a is integrally formed near a rear end of the rear output shaft 157, and the transfer drive gear 138a is engaged with a transfer driven gear 138b formed integrally with the rear drive shaft 137 to constitute a transfer gear train 138. The power transmitted from the second sun gear 163 to the rear output shaft 157 is transmitted to the rear drive shaft 137 through the transfer gear train 138. As shown in FIGS. 6 and 7, the differential limiting apparatus 141 is provided with a drum member 142 spline-fitted to the rear output shaft 157 at the rear of the center differential 135, and an annular sliding surface 142a is formed on the inner periphery of the drum member 142. An end portion of the pinion shaft 167 is protruded from the rear end surface of the carrier 166 supporting the pinion shaft 167, and a projection 167a of the pinion shaft 167 is made opposite to the sliding surface 142a inside the drum member 142. A cam member 143 is disposed between the sliding surface 42a and the projection 167a. The cam member 143 is provided with a partially arc-shaped friction surface 143a slidable on the sliding surface 142a and a V-shaped groove 143b engageable with the projection 167a. The friction surface 143a is brought into contact with the sliding surface 142a, and the V-shaped groove 143b is engaged with the projection 167a, so that the cam member 143 is supported between the sliding surface 142a and the projection 167a. When the cam member 143 is moved relatively to the carrier 166, a pressing force in the direction toward the sliding surface 142a is generated in the cam member 143 in accordance with a shift amount of engagement position of the V-shaped groove 143b with respect to the projection 167a. And then, the friction resistance of the friction surface 43a with respect to the sliding surface 142a is increased so that the differential limitation is made between the rear output shaft 157 and the carrier 166. Here, the friction surface 143a is formed on the cam member 143 by coating a friction material thereon or attaching/adhering a friction member, and so on. A pair of restriction sections 145, 145 is protrusively formed at the rear end surface of the carrier 166 and at both sides of the cam member 143. The restriction sections 145, 145 regulate the movement of the cam member 143 in both rotational directions of the carrier 166 while a predetermined swing is permitted, and when the cam member 143 is located at a symmetrical position with respect to the projection 167a, gaps of .delta.1 are respectively provided at both sides of the cam member 143. Here, by suitably setting the gap .delta.1, the amount of the movement of the cam member 143 with respect to the carrier 166 is regulated, and the maximum value of a differential limitation torque by the cam member 143 is set, and a lock by excessive movement of the cam member 143 is prevented. Besides, in the carrier 166, springs 146, 146 as a pair of energizing members are provided at both sides of the projection 167a, and the springs 146, 146 energize the cam member 143 in the direction toward the sliding surface 142a. Here, the energizing force by the springs 146, 146 is set to a minimum energizing force necessary for the cam member 143 to generate an initial torque between the front and rear wheels. At the same time, the springs 146, 146 have such a function that when the cam member 143 is moved relatively to the carrier 166, it is energized to restore/return to the original position. Next, the operation of the manual transmission 102 according to the above structure will be described. First, when the starting clutch 107 is disengaged to make a shift into a forward speed during a stop or running, any one of the first-speed to the fifth-speed gear trains 123 to 127 is selected by the synchro mechanism 130, 131 or 132 while being synchronized and unified with the input shaft 121. When the starting clutch 107 is engaged, the power of the engine 101 is inputted to the input shaft 121 of the manual gearbox 109, and the speed-changed power by the selected speed change gear train is outputted to the counter shaft 122. Besides, at the time of a stop, when a reverse shift is made in a state where the starting clutch 107 is disengaged, the reverse gear train 128 is engaged, and the reversed speed-changed power is outputted to the counter shaft 122, and in this way, speeds are changed to the five forward speeds and one backward speed. The power changed by the manual gearbox 109 is inputted to the first sun gear 160 of the center differential 135, and is transmitted to the pinion member 165 through the first pinion 161. Here, in the center differential 135, since a torque distribution ratio to the front and rear wheels is set to, for example, TF:TR=36.4:63.6 by respective gear data, the speed-changed power is distributed so that 36.4% is outputted to the carrier and 63.6% is outputted to the second sun gear 163. The power of the carrier 166 is transmitted to the front wheel through the hub 170, the front output shaft 155, the front drive shaft 136, and the final reduction gear 108. Besides, the power of the second sun gear 163 is transmitted to the rear wheel through the rear output shaft 157, the transfer gear train 138, the rear drive shaft 137, the propeller shaft 139, and the final reduction gear 140. In the torque distribution like this in which much importance is attached (needed) to the rear wheel, an over-steering is rather realized, and the rotational property, steering property, and the like become excellent (much better). When the four-wheel drive running conditions, the difference in the number of revolutions of the front and rear wheels generated at the time of rotation is absorbed by the planetary rotation of the first and second pinions 161 and 164 of the center differential 135, and free rotation becomes possible. When a differential motion is occurred between the rear output shaft 157 and the carrier 166, the engagement position of the V-shaped groove 143b with respect to the projection 167a is shifted. Namely, as shown in FIG. 7, when the drum portion 142 and the carrier 166 are relatively rotated, the cam member 143 is moved relatively to the carrier 166 by a minute friction resistance of the friction surface 143a with respect to the sliding surface 142a, so that the engagement position of the V-shaped groove 143b with respect to the projection 167a is shifted. In accordance with the shifting amount of the engagement position of the V-shaped groove 143b with respect to the projection 167a, the press force in the direction toward the sliding surface 142a is generated in the cam member 143, and the friction resistance of the friction surface 143a with respect to the sliding surface 142a is increased. Accordingly, the differential limitation is made between the rear output shaft 157 and the carrier 166. That is, when the cam member 143 is moved relatively to the carrier 166, the inclined surface of the V-shaped groove 143b is pressed to the projection 167a, and the friction resistance to the drum member 142 is increased. Here, in the above structure, since the cam member 143 is energized to the side of the sliding surface 142a of the drum member 142 by centrifugal force in accordance with the number of revolutions of the carrier 166, a differential limitation torque variably acts also by the number of revolutions (speeds). In the embodiment, a main portion of the differential limiting apparatus 141 has the projection 167a that is formed by protruding the end portion of the pinion shaft 167 from the end surface of the carrier 166, and the cam member 143 that is engaged with the projection 167a. Accordingly, the differential limiting apparatus 141 can be made simple and small-sized. That is, since the differential limiting apparatus does not have a plurality of clutch plates or the like, the structure can be made simple, and the whole length in the axial direction can be shortened. Besides, the characteristics of the differential limitation torque by the differential limiting apparatus 141 can be easily changed by merely changing an inclined angle of the V-shaped groove 143b, an interval of the restriction sections 145, 145, and the like, and the degree of freedom of design can be increased. Besides, the response of the differential limitation torque at the time of differential movement can be improved by energizing the cam member 143 toward the side of the sliding surface 142a by a predetermined weak energizing force caused by the springs 146, 146. Next, FIGS. 9 and 10 relate to a fourth embodiment according to the present invention, FIG. 9 is a main portion sectional view of a center differential, and FIG. 10 is a X--X sectional view of FIG. 9. Incidentally, in this embodiment, the same structure as the foregoing embodiment is designated by the same symbol, and the description is omitted. As shown in FIGS. 9 and 10, a differential limiting apparatus 171 is provided with a ring member 172 spline-fitted to a rear output shaft 157 at the rear of a center differential 135, and an annular sliding surface 172a is formed on the outer periphery of the ring member 172. Here, the sliding surface 172a may be directly formed on the rear output shaft 157 without spline-fitting the ring member 172 to the rear output shaft 157. Besides, an end portion of a pinion shaft 167 is protruded from a rear end surface of a carrier 166 supporting the pinion shaft 167, and a projection 167a of the pinion shaft 167 is made opposite to the sliding surface 172a of the ring member 172. Besides, a cam member 173 is disposed between the sliding surface 172a and the projection 167a. The cam member 173 is provided with a partially arc-shaped friction surface 173a slidable on the sliding surface 172a, and a V-shaped groove 173b engageable with the projection 167a. The friction surface 173a is brought into contact with the sliding surface 172a, and the V-shaped groove 173b is engaged with the projection 167a, so that the cam member 173 is supported between the sliding surface 172a and the projection 167a. When the cam member 173 is moved relative to the carrier 166 in accordance with the shifting amount of engagement position of the V-shaped groove 173b relative to the projection 167a, a press force in the direction toward the sliding surface 172a is generated in the cam member 173. At this time, the friction resistance of the friction surface 173a with respect to the sliding surface 172a is also increased, so that differential limitation is made between the rear output shaft 157 and the carrier 166. Here, the friction surface 173a is formed on the cam member 173 by coating the friction material/member, or by attaching the friction member, and so on. Besides, at the rear end surface of the carrier, a pair of restriction sections 175, 175 are protrusively formed at both sides of the cam member 173. The restriction sections 175, 175 regulate the movement of the cam member 173 in both rotation directions of the carrier 166 while a predetermined swing is permitted, and respectively have gaps of .delta.2 at both sides of the cam member 173 when the cam member 173 is located at a symmetrical position with respect to the projection 167a. Here, the amount of movement of the cam member 173 with respect to the carrier 166 is regulated by suitably setting the gap .delta.2, so that the maximum value of a differential limitation torque by the cam member 173 is set, and a lock by an excessive movement of the cam member 173 is prevented. Besides, in the carrier 166, springs 176, 176 as a pair of energizing members are provided at both sides of the projection 167a, and the springs 176, 176 energize the cam member 173 in the direction toward the sliding surface 172a. Here, the energizing force by the springs 176, 176 is set to a minimum energizing force necessary for the cam member 143 to generate an initial torque between the front and rear wheels. At the same time, the springs 176, 176 have such a function that when the cam member 173 is moved relatively to the carrier 166, it is energized to restore/return to the original position. According to the structure described above, substantially the same operation and effect as the foregoing embodiment according to the invention can be obtained. In this case, although a centrifugal force in accordance with the number of the revolutions of the carrier 166 acts on the cam member 173, contrary to the third embodiment, the centrifugal force acts in the direction to cancel the differential limitation torque. Although the description in the foregoing respective embodiments has been made on the example in which the differential limiting apparatus of the present invention is provided in the center differential, the present invention is not limited to this. The differential limiting apparatus according to the present invention may be applied to, for example, the planetary gear type differential in which the torque distribution between right and left wheels is made. Besides, the structure of the planetary gear type differential is not limited to one having the pair of sun gears and the pair of pinions. Besides, in the foregoing embodiments, although the description has been made on the differential in which both the carrier and the second sun gear are set as output components, the present invention is not limited to this, but for example, the carrier or the second sun gear may be setted as an input component. Note that although the above-mentioned embodiments according to the present invention are separately explained, it is possible for a person skill in the art to combine or utilize a main portion of one of embodiments to the other. While there has been described in connection with the preferred embodiments of the invention, it will be understood to those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications may be made therein without departing from the invention, and it is aimed, therefore, to cover in the appended claims all such changes and modifications as fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention. As described above, according to the third aspect of the present invention, the differential locking or limiting apparatus of the planetary gear type differential can be constructed to be simple and small-sized. * * * * *",

Description BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a transmission for a four wheel drive vehicle and more particularly to a power distribution apparatus of a twin shaft type transmission having an input shaft and a counter shaft. 2. Discussion of Prior Arts Some of so-called twin shaft type transmissions (transmissions having an input shaft for inputting power from an engine and a counter shaft on which shift gears are mounted) for four wheel drive vehicles employ a bevel gear type center differential for distributing power between front and rear wheels, as disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. Toku-Kai-Hei 7-167257. According to the technology proposed in the disclosure, the center differential is disposed coaxially with the counter shaft and power after gearshifting is inputted from the counter shaft through a differential casing. A pair of pinions are rotatably mounted on the differential case so as to equally distribute power inputted to the differential casing between front and rear wheels through a pair of side gears meshing with the pinions, respectively. A front drive shaft is coaxially disposed in the counter shaft. The power transmission to the front drive shaft is directly performed through a front output shaft connected to one side gear. Further, a rear drive shaft is coaxially disposed with an input shaft from an engine and the power transmission to the rear drive shaft is performed through a rear output shaft connected to the other side gear and a pair of transfer gears. Several technologies in which, in order to realize an unequal torque distribution between front and rear wheels and to enhance a cornering ability and a steering characteristic of a four wheel vehicle, a bevel gear type center differential is replaced with a planetary gear type center differential, have been proposed. For example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No Toku-Kai-Hei 5-112149 proposed by the applicant of the present invention discloses a technique in which, in an automatic transmission wherein an output shaft is disposed coaxially with an input shaft and a front drive shaft is arranged in parallel with these input and output shafts, a planetary gear type center differential is disposed coaxially with the output shaft and power transmitted from a first sun gear provided on the output shaft to a second sun gear through a second pinion is transmitted directly to a rear drive shaft and further power transmitted to a carrier through a pinion shaft supporting the first and second pinions is transmitted to a front drive shaft through a pair of reduction gears. However, in case of the twin shaft type transmission as disclosed in Toku-Kai-Hei 7-167257, it is difficult to dispose a planetary gear type center differential on the same axis as the counter shaft in place of the bevel gear type center differential. Since the front drive shaft is disposed inside of the counters haft, it is difficult to connect the reduction gear secured to the outer periphery of the carrier with the front drive shaft without incurring a large change of geometry and a complication of construction. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is an object of the present invention to provide a twin shaft type transmission for a four wheel drive vehicle having an input shaft for inputting power of an engine and a counter shaft capable of disposing a planetary gear type center differential on the same axis as the counter shaft with a simple constitution. To accomplish the object, a center differential accommodated in a twin shaft type transmission for a four wheel drive vehicle having an input shaft driveably connected with an engine, a hollow counter shaft arranged in parallel with the input shaft, shift gear trains provided between the input shaft and the counter shaft in a meshing relationship with each other, one of front and rear drive shafts coaxially provided in the counter shaft, the center differential comprises a hollow center differential input shaft connected coaxially with the counter shaft for inputting power to the center differential, a first sun gear mounted on the center differential input shaft, a second sun gear provided coaxially with the first sun gear for outputting power to the other of the front and rear drive shafts, a first pinion meshing with the first sun gear and provided around the center differential input shaft, a second pinion formed integrally with the first pinion and meshing with the second sun gear, a carrier rotatably holding the first and second pinions and enclosing the first and second sun gears and the first and second pinions therein for outputting power to one of the front and rear drive shafts, and a hub secured to the inside of the carrier and extending through a space between the first and second sun gears to the inside of the center differential input shaft and connected with one of the front and rear drive shaft. DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 is a sectional view showing a center differential portion according to the present invention; FIG. 2 is a skeleton diagram showing a transmission according to the present invention; and FIG. 3 is an explanatory view of differential limiting torque. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Referring now to FIGS. 1 and 2, reference numeral 1 denotes an engine disposed in a front portion of a vehicle and reference numeral 2 denotes a transmission gearbox connected to a rear part of the engine 1. Behind a clutch housing 3 of the transmission gearbox 2, a transmission case 4 is formed integrally. Further, a transfer case 5 is connected with a rear part of the transmission case 4. Further, an extension case 6 is connected with a rear part of the transfer case 5. The clutch housing 3 includes a starting clutch 7, the transmission case 4 includes a final reduction gear unit 8 and a manual transmission 9 and the transfer case 5 includes a transfer section 10. A crankshaft 11 of the engine 1 is connected with the starting clutch 7 and the starting clutch 7 is connected with an input shaft 21 of the manual transmission 9. The manual transmission 9 has a hollow counter shaft 22 provided in parallel with the input shaft 21 and a 1.sup.st gear train 23, a 2.sup.nd gear train 24; a 3.sup.rd gear train 25 and a 4.sup.th gear train 26 are arranged in this order between the input shaft 21 and the counter shaft 22. A synchromesh mechanisms 30 is provided between the 1.sup.st gear train 23 and the 2.sup.nd gear train 24 and a synchromesh mechanism 31 is provided between the 3.sup.rd gear train 25 and the 4.sup.th gear train 26, respectively. Further, a reverse gear train 28 is disposed between the 1.sup.st gear train 23 and the 2.sup.nd gear train 24. Further, the input shaft 21 and counter shaft 22 extends inside of the transfer case 5 in which a 5.sup.th gear train 27 and synchromesh mechanism 32 are disposed between these two shafts. Thus, the manual transmission 9 is constituted so as to be shifted to any one of five forward speed gears by selectively actuating those three synchromesh mechanisms 30, 31 and 32 and to be shifted to a reverse position by engaging the reverse gear train 28. In the transfer case 5, a planetary gear type center differential 35 is disposed on the counter shaft 22. The center differential 35 is driveably connected with a front drive shaft 36 disposed in the counter shaft 22 and also driveably connected with a rear drive shaft 37 disposed on the sane axis as the input shaft 21 through a transfer gear train 38 so as to distribute a shifted power inputted from the counter shaft 22 between both drive shafts 36, 37. Further, the power transmitted to the front drive shaft 36 is transmitted to the final reduction gear unit 8 of front wheels and on the other hand the power transmitted to the rear drive shaft 37 is transmitted to a final reduction gear unit 40 of rear wheels through a propeller shaft 39. Next, the constitution of the center differential 35 according to the present invention will be described in detail by reference to FIG. 1. The center differential 35 includes a hollow center differential input shaft 51 spline-fitted at an end portion thereof to the outer periphery of the counter shaft 22 through an intermediate member 50, a hollow front output shaft 55 spline-fitted at an end portion thereof over the outer periphery of the hollow front output shaft 55 through a intermediate member 54 and a rear output shaft 57 fitted at an end portion thereof to the front output shaft 55. These shafts 51, 55 and 57 are in a rotatable relationship with each other. A first sun gear 60 having a large diameter is formed integrally with the center differential 51 at the other end thereof and a plurality of first pinions 61 meshes with the first sun gear 60. In this embodiment, three first pinions 61 are arranged around the first sun gear 60 at an equal interval. Also, a second sun gear 63 having a small diameter is spline-fitted to the rear output shaft 57 and a plurality of second pinions 64 having a large diameter mesh with the second sun gear 63 therearound. In this embodiment, three second pinions 64 are arranged around the second sun gear 63 at an equal interval. A first pinion 61 and a second pinion 64 are formed integrally on a pinion member 65, forming a pair of the first and second pinions 61, 64. In this embodiment, three pairs of first and second pinions 61, 64 are formed on the pinion member 65. The pinion member 65 is rotatably supported by a pinion shaft 67 secured to a carrier 66. That is, the center differential input shaft 51 is rotatably fitted to the carrier 66 from the front and the rear output shaft 57 is rotatably fitted to the carrier 66 from the rear. The first sun gear 60 and the second sun gear 63 are accommodated in a space enclosed by the carrier 66. Further, the pinion shaft 67 is provided across the front and rear part of the carrier 66 in such a manner that the first pinion 61 meshes with the first sun gear 60 and the second pinion 64 meshes with the second sun gear 63. The rear end of the front output shaft 55 is projected into the carrier 66. A hub 70 secured to the inner periphery of the carrier 66 extends inwardly through a space between the first and second sun gears 60, 63 and is spline-fitted over the front output shaft 55 at the rear end thereof. Further, power transmitted from the pinion member 65 to the carrier 66 through the pinion shaft 67 is transmitted to the front drive shaft 36 through the hub 70 and the front output shaft 55. On the other hand, a transfer drive gear 38a is integrally formed with the rear output shaft 57 at the rear thereof. Further, a transfer drive gear 38b meshing with the transfer drive gear 38a is integrally formed with the rear drive shaft 37, constituting a transfer gear train 38. Power transmitted to the rear output shaft 57 through the second sun gear 63 is transmitted to the rear drive shaft 37 through the transfer gear train 38, after being shifted by the transmission. Further, a cylindrical clutch hub 75 is secured to the rear surface of the carrier 66 around the rear output shaft 57. Further, a clutch drum 76 is secured to the rear output shaft 57 opposite to the clutch hub 75. Further, a drive plate 77, a driven plate 78 and a coned disc spring 79 are provided in a space between the clutch hub 75 and the clutch drum 76. Thus, an initial torque generating section 80 is constituted by these components. The initial torque generating section 80 is for generating an initial torque operating between the carrier 66 and the rear output shaft 57, namely between front and rear wheels and is established such that the generating initial torque is a minimum of necessity by properly establishing the pressure of the coned disc spring 79. Distribution of reference torque of the center differential 35 between front and rear wheels is established to a desired ratio, for example, TF:TR=36.4:63.6 by properly establishing an intermeshing pitch radius of the first sun gear 60 and the first pinion 61 and an intermeshing pitch radius of the second sun gear 63 and the second pinion 64. A first friction washer 81 as a first friction member is provided between the first sun gear 60 and the hub 70, a second friction washer 82 as a second friction member is provided between the second sun gear 63 and the hub 70 and a third friction washer 83 as a third friction member is provided between the second sun gear 63 and the carrier 66, respectively. That is, these friction washers 81, 82 and 83 constitute a differential limiting mechanism of the center differential 35. Since the first sun gear 60 and the first pinion 61 are constituted by helical gears, when forwarding the first pinion 61 generates such a thrust load as biasing the first sun gear 60 rearwardly (on the hub 70 side). Further, since the second sun gear 63 and the second pinion 64 are constituted by helical gears, when forwarding the second pinion 64 generates such a thrust load as biasing the second sun gear 63 forwardly (on the hub 70 side). As a result, the first friction washer 81 and the second friction washer 82 are pressed against the hub 70 by the first and second sun gears 60, 63 respectively to generate differential limiting torque. When rearwarding, the thrust load of the second sun gear 63 generates in a reverse direction and as a result the third friction washer 82 is pressed on the carrier 66 by the second sun gear 63 to generate differential limiting torque. Next, an operation of thus constituted manual transmission 2 will be described. First, when the starting clutch 7 is released during stops or running and the gear is shifted to a forward position, either of the first to fifth gears 23 to 27 is selected while synchronizing with the input shaft 21. After that, when the clutch 7 is engaged, power of the engine 1 is inputted to the input shaft 21 of the manual transmission 9 and the power shifted by the selected gear train is outputted to the counter shaft 22. Further, when the gear is shifted to a reverse position while the starting clutch 7 is released during stops, the reverse gear train 28 is engaged and the power inversed by the reverse gear train is outputted to the counter shaft 22. Thus, the engine power is shifted to five forward speed positions and one reverse position. The power shifted by the manual transmission 9 is inputted to the first sun gear 60 of the center differential 35 and is transmitted to the pinion member 65 through the first pinion 61. Since the center differential 35 has a torque distribution ratio between front and rear wheels established to TF:TR=36.4:63.6 by properly selecting gear dimensions, the shifted power is distributed and outputted to the carrier 66 by 36.4% and to the second sun gear 63 by 63.6%, respectively. The power transmitted to the carrier 66 is transmitted to the front wheels through the hub 70, the front output shaft 55, the front driveshaft 36 and the final reduction gear unit 8. According to the rear-over distributed torque distribution ratio of this embodiment, the vehicle has a taste of oversteer and as a result good turning ability and good steering characteristic. When the differential rotation generates between front and rear wheels, the first and second friction washer 81, 82 provides the center differential 35 with a differential limiting effect automatically when forwarding and the third friction washer 83 provides the center differential 35 with a differential limiting effect automatically when rearwarding. As a result, maneuverability and steering stability of the vehicle is enhanced. As illustrated in FIG. 3, since the first friction washer 81 substantially produces a differential limiting between the center differential input shaft 51 and the front output shaft 55, a differential limiting torque obtained by an equivalent friction washer of the first friction washer 81 is 1/2 times that of the second friction washer 82 or the third friction washer 83 substantially producing a differential limiting between the front output shaft 55 and the rear output shaft 57. According to the embodiment like this, the center differential input shaft 51 formed into a hollow is connected with the counter shaft 22, the front output shaft 55 from the center differential 51 disposed inside of the center differential 51 is connected with the front drive shaft 36, and the hub 70 secured to the carrier 66 extending to the inside of the center differential input shaft 51 through the slit between the first and second sun gears 60 and 63, is connected with the front output shaft 55. Thus, according to the construction of the center differential 33 of this embodiment, the carrier 66 can be driveably connected with the front drive shaft 36 disposed in the counter shaft 22 with a simple structure. Accordingly, in the twin shaft type transmission for a four wheel drive vehicle, a planetary gear type center differential can be disposed coaxially with the counter shaft with a simple construction and can easily realize an unequal torque distribution between front and rear wheels. In particular, since the front output shaft 55 and the rear output shaft 57 can be disposed coaxially inside of the center differential input shaft 51, interchangeability with a bevel gear type center differential in which the front and rear output shafts are disposed coaxially inside of a differential case can be enhanced. In other words, in case of a twin shaft type transmission for a four wheel drive vehicle in which a front drive shaft is disposed in a counter shaft and having a bevel gear type center differential, the bevel gear type center differential can be easily replaced with a planetary gear type center differential without incurring a large geometric change and complication of construction. Further, since the first, second and third friction washers 81, 82 and 83 are disposed between the first sun gear 60 and the hub 70, between the hub 70 and the second sun gear 63 and between the second sun gear 63 and the carrier 66, respectively, a differential limiting mechanism can be incorporated in the center differential 35 with a simple construction and as a result down-sizing and weight reduction of a transmission can be realized. In this case, particularly, a differential limiting mechanism can be easily accommodated in the carrier 66 by making use of the hub 70 secured to the carrier 66. Further, since the first and second sun gears 60, 63 and the first and second pinions 61, 64 are constituted by helical gears, when forwarding the first and second pinions 61, 64 exert the first and second sun gears 60, 63 towards the hub 70 side and the first and second friction washers 81 and 82 simultaneously generate differential limiting effect. Further, when rearwarding, since the second pinion 64 exerts the second sun gear 63 towards the carrier 66 side, the third friction washer 83 generates differential limiting effect. That is, the differential limiting torque can be easily established by simultaneously operating both the first and second friction washers 81 and 82 which perform differential limiting on different shafts. Further, on establishing differential limiting torque, this provides vehicle designers with an expanded range of tunings within which vehicle performance can be tailored for specific requirements. While the presently preferred embodiment of the present invention has been shown and described, it is to be understood that this disclosure is for the purpose of illustration and that various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims. * * * * *",

Description BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a drive system for a vehicle, more particularly, to a drive system capable of transmitting driving force of a longitudinally mounted engine through a continuously variable transmission to drive wheels of the vehicle. 2. Prior Art A belt driven continuously variable transmission has a primary pulley mounted on a primary shaft, a secondary pulley mounted on a secondary shaft provided in parallel with the primary shaft and a belt looped over the primary and secondary pulleys. Generally, the pulley diameter of the primary and secondary pulleys is determined based on miscellaneous design requirements such as pulley strength, belt strength, speed ratio and others. As a result, the pulleys need some amount of diameter and therefore a large distance is needed between the primary and secondary shafts. In case of a transversely mounted engine, that is, an engine whose crank shaft is arranged in the widthwise direction of the vehicle, such distance is not so big problem because the transversely mounted engine provides a relatively large longitudinal space in an engine room. On the other hand, in a longitudinally mounted engine, an engine whose crank shaft is arranged in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle, since the primary shaft of the continuously variable transmission is connected with the crank shaft through a starting apparatus such as torque converter, electromagnetic clutch and the like, the secondary shaft must be arranged under the primary shaft. This arrangement requires a large vertical size to the transmission and also increases agitation loss of lubrication oil. Further, in case of a vehicle such as front wheel drive vehicle or four wheel drive vehicle, a front differential must be incorporated in the engine room. In this case, a problem is that the total vertical length of the continuously variable transmission including the front differential extends further downwardly. In order to reduce the vertical length of the transmission, it is considered that the differential is arranged in an offsetting manner from the center of the vehicle to a left or right side. The problem of this arrangement is an unbalance in weight due to the left and right drive axles with unequal length. In general, in case where an engine is longitudinally mounted, the longitudinal length of the engine room tends to become large. It is desirable to reduce the longitudinal size of the drive system in order to secure a large space of the passenger compartment. Particularly, it is desirable to design so as not to make a protrusion of a toe board into the passenger compartment. Japanese Patent Applications Laid-open No. Toku-Kai-Hei 9-267652 and No. Toku-Kai-Hei 9-277842 disclose drive systems having a belt driven continuously variable transmission combined with a longitudinally mounted engine. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is an object of the present invention to provide a small size, particularly short length drive system for transmitting power of a longitudinally mounted engine to driving wheels through a belt drive continuously variable transmission. The drive system comprises an input shaft extending in a longitudinal direction of a vehicle and connecting a starting device with a forward and reverse changeover apparatus, a primary shaft for mounting a primary pulley arranged in parallel with the input shaft on one lateral side of the input shaft, a secondary shaft for mounting a secondary pulley arranged in parallel with the input shaft on the other lateral side of the input shaft and a hollow drive shaft rotatably fitted over the input shaft for transmitting output of the forward and reverse changeover apparatus to the primary shaft. Further, the input shaft penetrates a space surrounded by a drive belt looped over the primary and secondary pulleys.

DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Referring now to FIG. 1, an engine 10 is mounted on the front side of an engine room in the center of a transverse direction of a vehicle and a crank shaft 11 of the engine 10 is arranged in a longitudinal direction of the vehicle. The crank shaft 11 is connected with a torque converter 12 which acts as a starting device through a drive plate 12a. On the rear side of the engine room, a forward and reverse changeover apparatus 13 is disposed opposite to the torque converter 12. Further, the torque converter 12 is interconnected with the forward and reverse changeover apparatus 13 through an input shaft 14. The torque converter 12 includes a pump impeller 12cprovided in a pump case 12b which is connected with the crank shaft 11 through a converter case 12h and a turbine runner 12d disposed opposite to the pump impeller 12c. A stator 12e is disposed between the pump impeller 12c and turbine runner 12d and is supported by an one-way clutch 12f. An output shaft of the torque converter 12 is integral with the input shaft 14. There is provided a lock-up clutch 12g to engage or disengage with a converter case 12h connected to the drive plate 12a. The rotational power of the engine 10 is transmitted to the input shaft 14 through the turbine runner 12d or the lock-up clutch 12g. A primary shaft 15 is arranged in parallel with the input shaft 14. The primary shaft 15 is rigidly connected with a fixed sheave 16a and a moving sheave 16b is slidably mounted in a face-to-face relationship with the fixed sheave 16a on the primary shaft 15, a primary pulley 16 being formed by the fixed sheave 16a and the moving sheave 16b. Thus a groove width of the primary pulley 16 is varied by sliding the moving sheave 16b in an axial direction of the primary shaft 15. A secondary shaft 17 is arranged in parallel with the input shaft 14. The secondary shaft 17 is rigidly connected with a fixed sheave 18a and a moving sheave 18b is slidably mounted in a face-to-face relationship with the fixed sheave 18a on the secondary shaft 17, a secondary pulley 18 being formed by the fixed sheave 18a and the moving sheave 18b. Thus, a groove width of the secondary pulley 18 is varied by sliding the moving sheave 18b in an axial direction of the secondary shaft 17. A steel belt 19 is looped over both pulleys 16, 18 in order to transmit diving force from the primary pulley 16 on a driving side to the secondary pulley 18 on a driven side, thus a belt driven continuously variable transmission being formed. As shown in FIG. 5, a rotation center O.sub.E of the input shaft 14 agrees with a rotation center of the engine 10, namely, a rotation center of the crank shaft 11. Accordingly, the crank shaft 11 is connected with the input shaft 14 on a common axis extended in a longitudinal direction of the vehicle. The primary shaft 15 is arranged at a specified distance away from the input shaft 14 on one widthwise side of the input shaft 14. On the other hand, the secondary shaft 17 is arranged on the other widthwise side of the input shaft 14. The belt 19 is wound around the primary pulley 16 and the secondary pulley 18 such that it surrounds the input shaft 14. Thus, since two pulleys of heavy weight are disposed in an approximate laterally symmetrical relationship with respect to the input shaft 14, the vehicle can keep a balance in weight. The input shaft 14, as shown in FIG. 5, penetrates a space surrounded by a loop formed by the belt 19 wound around both pulleys 16, 18. Thus providing the input shaft 14 inside the belt 19 is advantageous in reducing the overall height of the drive system. Further, since such an arrangement can minimize a distance between both centers of pulleys 16, 18, it is possible to reduce the widthwise size of the belt driven continuously variable transmission. The belt 19 illustrated in a solid line shows a state of minimum winding diameter in the primary pulley 16 and maximum winding diameter in the secondary pulley 18. Further, the belt 19 illustrated in a two-dot chain line shows a state of maximum winding diameter in the primary pulley 16 and minimum winding diameter in the secondary pulley 18. When the belt 19 is displaced between these states, the input shaft 14 is situated at a position where the belt 19 has no contact with the input shaft 14. A rotation center O.sub.P of the primary shaft 15 is located at a higher position than the rotation center O.sub.E of the input shaft 14 and a rotation center O.sub.S of the secondary shaft 17 is located at a lower position than the primary shaft 15. This arrangement enables to install a differential 41 having a crown gear 42 with large diameter in proximity to the pulleys under both pulley shafts. The forward and reverse changeover apparatus 13 employs double pinion type planetary gears, comprising a forward clutch 21 connected to the input shaft 14 and a reverse brake 22 attached to a transmission housing. A sun gear 23 is secured to the input shaft 14 and pinions 27, 28 is provided around the sun gear 23. Further, a ring gear is provided around the pinions 27, 28. The reverse brake 22 is for fixing the ring gear 24 or allowing the rotation of the ring gear 24 by means of friction plates provided in the reverse brake 22. A hollow drive shaft 25 is rotatably fitted over the input shaft 14. A carrier 26 is secured to the hollow drive shaft 25. The carrier 26 rotatably supports the pinion 27 which meshes with the sun gear 23 and the pinion 28 which meshes with the pinion 27 and the ring gear 24. On the other hand, the carrier 26 is connected with the forward clutch 21 having a friction plate. The engagement or disengagement of the forward clutch 21 and the reverse brake 22 is performed by hydraulic pistons (not shown). In order to transmit the output of the forward and reverse changeover apparatus 13 to the primary shaft 15, there is provided a gear 32 meshing with a gear 31 secured to the primary shaft 15 on the hollow drive shaft 25. As shown in FIG. 5, it should be noted that since the input shaft 14 is arranged inside of the loop formed by the belt 19, the outer diameter of the gears 31, 32 can be designed to be small, respectively. When the reverse brake 22 is OFF, that is, the ring gear 24 is in a rotatable state, and when the forward clutch 21 is ON, that is, the carrier 26 is engaged with the input shaft 14, the power of the engine 10 transmitted to the input shaft 14 through the torque converter 12 is transferred in a forward rotation to the primary shaft 15 through the gears 32, 31. On the other hand, when the reverse brake 22 is ON, that is, the ring gear 24 is in a fixed state, and when the forward clutch 21 is OFF, that is, the carrier 26 is disengaged from the input shaft 14, the engine power of the input shaft 14 is transferred in a reverse rotation to the primary shaft 15 through the planetary gears. A cylinder 33 is provided around the primary shaft 15 to vary the groove width of the primary pulley 16. The cylinder 33 forms an oil chamber 33a together with the moving sheave 16b. Similarly, a cylinder 34 is provided around the secondary shaft 17 to vary the groove width of the secondary pulley 18. The cylinder 34 forms an oil chamber 34a together with the moving sheave 18b. An oil pump 35 is driven by the crank shaft 11 through a pump case 12b to generate hydraulic pressure. The hydraulic pressure is fed to the respective oil chambers 33a, 34a after being regulated and operates the moving sheaves 16b, 18b respectively. Generally, the diameter of the cylinder on the primary pulley side is larger than that of the cylinder on the secondary pulley side. Further, the longitudinal or axial length of the moving sheave on the primary side is shorter than that of the moving sheave on the secondary side. In this embodiment, the cylinder 33 of the primary pulley 16 is disposed on the side of the torque converter 12 and therefore the moving sheave 16b of the primary pulley 16 is also on the side of the torque converter 12. Accordingly, the primary pulley assembly including the cylinder 33 and moving sheave 16b can near the torque converter 12 side and as a result, the overall length of the transmission can be reduced. As shown in FIG. 5, a reduction gear 36 is secured to the secondary shaft 17 and an intermediate gear 37 meshing with the gear 36 is provided under the gear 36. As illustrated in FIG. 3, a drive shaft 38 is rotatably disposed in parallel with the input shaft 14 and a drive pinion 39 secured to the drive shaft 38 is in meshed engagement with the intermediate gear 37. In FIG. 3, an oil pan 40 is provided under a housing of the drive system and a part of the drive pinion 39 dips in lubrication oil in the oil pan 40. Thus, lubrication oil is supplied to the reduction gear 36 in company with the rotation of the drive pinion 39. As shown in FIGS. 4 and 5, there is provided a final reduction gear unit, a front differential 41 under the primary and secondary pulleys 16, 18. A crown gear 42 of the differential 41 is in meshed engagement with a hypoid gear 43 provided on the rear end of the drive shaft 38. Summarizing the layout of the drive system according to the embodiment of the present invention, the torque converter 12 and the forward and reverse changeover apparatus 13 are arranged in a face-to-face relationship with each other and the pulley and belt assembly is disposed between the torque converter 12 and the forward and reverse changeover apparatus 13. Furthermore, the input shaft 14 connecting the torque converter 12 and the forward and reverse changeover apparatus 13 penetrates the pulley and belt assembly. Further, the differential 41 is disposed in a space under the pulley and belt assembly. This layout provides the drive system for a longitudinally mounted engine with a compactness, particularly a short longitudinal size and a symmetrical arrangement. As a result, in a continuous variable transmission having disadvantage in an extended longitudinal length when applied to a longitudinally mounted engine, it is possible to mount the dive system on a vehicle without interfering with the toe board. Further, it is possible to install the drive system according to the present invention in an engine room of a conventional vehicle without making major modifications. Further, since the pulley and belt assembly is disposed above the differential 41, the belt 19 or pulleys 16, 18 can be prevented from agitating lubrication oil in the oil pan and as a result agitation loss of lubrication oil can be reduced and an increase of oil temperature can be prevented. Further, since the secondary pulley 18 of the driven side is disposed at a lower position than the primary pulley 16, the distance between the rotation center of the secondary pulley 18 and the drive shaft 38 can be reduced, as a result the outer diameter of the reduction gear 36, the intermediate gear 37 and the drive pinion 39 can be decreased. The differential 41 has an output shaft 44 extending in the widthwise direction of the vehicle. The output shaft 44 is connected at left and right ends thereof with left and right front wheels through left and right constant velocity universal joints 45, 45, respectively. The center O.sub.D of the differential 41 is disposed in vicinity of a vertical line V passing through the rotation center O.sub.E of the input shaft 14 or crank shaft 11 and the distances D.sub.R, D.sub.L from the vertical line V to the left and right constant velocity universal joints are designed to be identical. If the rotation center O.sub.E of the input shaft 14 is rendered identical to the widthwise center of the vehicle, the length of the left and right drive axles extending from the constant velocity universal joints can be equalized to each other. This is important to keep balance of driving force between left and right wheels. In this embodiment, the torque converter 12 is employed as a starting device of the continuously variable transmission, however other means such as an electromagnetic clutch may be replaced with the torque converter 12. Further, the drive system according to the present invention has been described based on an example of front wheel-drive vehicles, however the drive system may be also applied to four wheel-drive vehicles. While the presently preferred embodiment of the present invention has been shown and described, it is to be understood that this disclosure is for the purpose of illustration and that various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims. * * * * *",

Description TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to an automobile driving system and, more specifically, to an automobile driving system capable of transmitting the driving force of an engine by a transmission capable of changing the output speed, and of driving two wheels selectively in a forward drive mode or a reverse drive mode by a double-pinion planetary gear, or distributing the driving force to the front and the rear axles of the vehicle and driving four wheels selectively in a forward drive mode or a reverse drive mode by a double-pinion planetary gear. BACKGROUND ART A prior art automobile driving system including a longitudinal arrangement of an engine and a transmission is disclosed in JP-A No. 51-89066. As shown in FIG. 1, this prior art automobile driving system is of a substantially U-shaped drive line in which an engine 1001, a torque converter 1002 and a belt-drive variable-speed transmission 1003 are disposed coaxially in a longitudinal arrangement, a reverse gear 1004 including a planetary gear is interposed between the torque converter 1002 and the belt-drive variable-speed transmission 1003, and power is transmitted from the belt-drive variable-speed transmission 1003 through a drive shaft 1006 to a differential gear 1005 disposed under the engine 1001. This automobile driving system, however, has a relatively great length along the longitudinal axis of the vehicle body because the engine 1001, the torque converter 1002, the reverse gear 1004 and the transmission 1003 are arranged coaxially in a longitudinal arrangement. Therefore, a rear portion of the automobile driving system interferes with the wall of a tunnel formed under a passenger chamber in the vehicle body when the automobile driving system is installed in an engine room and hence the wall of the tunnel must be unavoidably protruded into the passenger chamber. Furthermore, a toe board separating the engine room and the passenger room from each other unavoidably needs to be shifted toward the passenger room, which reduces the space of the passenger room, adversely affecting the comfortability of the passenger room. Since the automobile driving system is disposed close to the toe board, the passenger room needs to be further reduced to secure a sufficient crush stroke for safety in case of head-on collision, which further spoils the comfortability of the passenger room. Moreover, it is difficult to secure a sufficient working space in the engine room which makes work for installing the automobile driving system in the engine room and maintenance work difficult. In an automobile driving system shown in FIG. 2 proposed to solve the foregoing problems, a torque converter 1002 and a belt-drive variable-speed transmission 1003 are disposed coaxially behind an engine 1001 in a longitudinal arrangement. A reverse gear 1004 and a differential gear 1005 are disposed under the engine 1001, and the output driving force of the transmission 1003 is transmitted through the reverse gear 1004 and a drive shaft 1006 to the differential gear 1005. Thus, the length a of the automobile driving system along the axis of the vehicle is relatively small. Although the disposition of the reverse gear interposed between the torque converter and the belt-drive variable-speed transmission under the engine is effective in reducing the length a along the longitudinal axis of the vehicle, the overall height h of the automobile driving system increases as shown in FIG. 2. The automobile driving system having such a relatively great overall height h imposes restrictions on the design of a slant nose body and limits the freedom of vehicle body design. The foregoing prior art automobile driving systems are intended for use on a two-wheel drive vehicle. A center differential gear must be interposed between the reverse gear and the differential gear when constructing a automobile driving system for a four-wheel drive vehicle on the basis of those prior art automobile driving systems to distribute the output driving force of the reverse gear to the front and the rear axles. Consequently, a portion of the gear train lying under the engine protrudes greatly downward and the automobile driving system has a complicated construction. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to solve the foregoing problems in the foregoing prior art automobile driving systems and to provide a compact automobile driving system having relatively small longitudinal and transverse dimensions, increasing the degree of freedom of vehicle body design, and securing a space for crush stroke and driving system mounting and dismounting work. Another object of the present invention is to provide an automobile driving system having a simple construction, comprising component parts common to various types, and, when designed for use on a two-wheel drive vehicle, capable of being readily modified for use on a four-wheel drive vehicle. DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION According to a first aspect of the present invention, an automobile driving system for a two-wheel drive vehicle comprises an engine, a transmission which receives the output of the engine, a drive shaft extended in parallel to the crankshaft of the engine to transmit power to a differential gear, a double-pinion planetary gear having a sun gear operatively connected to the drive shaft, an input member for transmitting the output power of the transmission to a carrier included in the planetary gear, a first friction coupling element for selectively transmitting power from the carrier of the planetary gear to the drive shaft, and a second friction coupling element for selectively allowing a ring gear included in the planetary gear to rotate or restraining the same from rotation. The first and the second friction coupling element are operated selectively to set the automobile driving system selectively in a forward drive mode or a reverse drive mode. More concretely, this automobile driving system comprises an engine, a transmission which receives the output of the engine, a front drive shaft extended in parallel to the crankshaft of the engine to transmit power to a front differential gear, a double-pinion planetary gear having a sun gear operatively connected to the front drive shaft, an input member for transmitting the output power of the transmission to a carrier included in the planetary gear, a first friction coupling element for selectively transmitting power from the carrier of the planetary gear to the front drive shaft, and a second friction coupling element for selectively allowing a ring gear included in the planetary gear to rotate or restraining the same from rotation. When the automobile driving system is set in the forward drive mode, the first friction coupling element is set in a state for power transmission and the second friction coupling element is set in a state for allowing the rotation of the ring gear. When the automobile driving system is set in the reverse drive mode, the first friction coupling element is disengaged and the second friction coupling element restrains the ring gear from rotation. The component parts of the automobile driving system are common to a type for two-wheel drive vehicle and a type for a four-wheel vehicle and hence an automobile driving system for a four-wheel drive vehicle can be readily assembled by using parts for an automobile driving system for a two-wheel vehicle. According to a second aspect of the present invention, an automobile driving system for a four-wheel drive vehicle comprises, in addition to the component of the automobile driving system for a two-wheel drive vehicle, a rear drive shaft extended in parallel to the crankshaft of the engine to transmit power to a rear differential gear, and a fifth friction coupling element for selectively interlocking the front drive shaft and the rear drive shaft. The input member serves as an input selecting means for selectively transmitting the output power of the transmission to the ring gear or the carrier of the planetary gear, the first friction coupling element is able to transmit the output power of the planetary gear to the rear drive shaft, the input selecting means and the friction coupling elements are engaged and disengaged selectively to distribute the output power of the transmission by the planetary gear to the front and the rear drive shaft and to set the automobile driving system in the forward drive mode or the reverse drive mode. According to a third aspect of the present invention, an automobile driving system for a four-wheel drive vehicle comprises an engine, a transmission which receives the output power of the engine, a first drive shaft extended in parallel to the crankshaft of the engine to transmit power to one of two differential gears, a second drive shaft extended in parallel to the crankshaft of the engine to transmit power to the other differential gear, and a double-pinion planetary gear to distribute input power received from the transmission to the first and the second drive shaft and to set the automobile driving system selectively in a forward drive mode or a reverse drive mode. The engine is mounted longitudinally or transversely on a vehicle body. The output of the engine is transmitted to the ring gear or the carrier of the planetary gear or to the ring gear or the sun gear of the planetary gear. The planetary gear may be disposed coaxially with the first drive shaft. The double planetary gear is disposed apart from the transmission to enable the interposition of the input selecting means between the double planetary gear and the transmission. The transmission comprises a primary shaft, a secondary shaft parallel to the primary shaft, a primary pulley mounted on the primary shaft, a secondary pulley mounted on the secondary shaft, and a drive belt extended between the primary and the secondary pulley. The ratio between the respective pitch diameters of the primary and the secondary pulley is varied to make the transmission function as a belt-drive variable-speed transmission. The above and other features of the present invention will become more apparent from the following description taken in connection with the accompanying drawings.

A hydraulic control system varies the width of the groove between the movable and fixed cones of the primary pulley 123 and the secondary pulley 124 to vary the ratio between the pitch diameters of the primary pulley 123 and the secondary pulley 124, whereby the rotating speed of the secondary shaft 122 is varied continuously. A primary reduction gear 128 is mounted on the secondary shaft 124, and power is transmitted through a primary driven gear 129 engaged with the primary reduction gear 128 to the transfer unit 140 contained in the third case 103 and the fourth case 104. An output driving force of the transfer unit 140 is transmitted, for example, through the front differential gear 130 to front wheels. FIG. 4 is a sectional view of an essential portion of the front differential gear 130 and FIG. 5 is a perspective view of an essential portion of the front differential gear 130, in which the transmission case 106 is omitted. Referring to FIGS. 4 and 5, a differential gear case 131 having a gear case 131a and a substantially cylindrical crown gear support member 131b formed integrally with the gear case 131a is disposed transversely in and supported for rotation in a plurality of bearings 132 on the fifth case 105. The crown gear support member 131b has a flange 131c, and a crown gear 133 is attached to the flange 131c. A front drive shaft 141 is operatively connected to the crown gear 133. A differential gear 134 is constructed by supporting a pair of pinions 134b in the gear case 131a by pinion shafts 134a, and engaging right and left side gears 134c and 134d with the pinions 134b. A drive shaft 135 connected to the side gears 134c is extended from the gear case 131a through the crown gear support member 131b, and transmits driving force to one of the front wheels through a constant-velocity joint and an axle. A drive shaft 136 connected to the other side gear 134d projects from the gear case 131a and transmits driving force through a constant-speed joint and an axle to the other front wheel. As viewed from above, the crown gear 133 is located at a position between the primary shaft 121 and the secondary shaft 122 below the variable-speed transmission 120. The crown gear 133 and the gear case 131a are disposed on the opposite sides, respectively, of the primary shaft 121 within the fifth case 105. Therefore, the crown gear 133 can be formed in a diameter smaller than that of a conventional crown gear which is mounted on the outer circumference of a differential gear case containing the differential gear 134. Thus, the front differential gear 130 has a relatively small overall size. The variable-speed transmission 120 and the front differential gear 130 can be disposed close to each other by disposing the front differential gear 130 with a middle portion of a relatively small diameter thereof between the crown gear 133 and the gear case 131a positioned opposite to the primary shaft 121. As shown in FIG. 3, an oil pump 116 which is driven continuously by a stator shaft 115 included in the torque converter 113 is contained in the second case 102. The oil pump 116 discharges oil at a line pressure continuously to supply the oil to the torque converter 113 and associated parts, enables the hydraulic control of the variable-speed transmission 120, and enables the hydraulic control of the transfer unit 140 by a hydraulic controller 138 on the basis of signals provided by a traveling speed sensor 137a, a throttle opening sensor 137b and a shift switch 137c. The construction of the transfer unit 140 will be described with reference to FIGS. 3 and 4. As shown in FIG. 3, the transfer unit 140 has a front drive shaft 141, i.e., a first drive shaft, extended in parallel to the crankshaft 111 of the engine 110, the output shaft 114, the primary shaft 121 and the secondary shaft 122. As is obvious from FIG. 8, i.e., a view taken in the direction of the arrow A in FIG. 6, the crankshaft 111, the primary shaft 121, the secondary shaft 122 and the front drive shaft 141 are extended in parallel to each other, the axis 111a of rotation of the crankshaft 111 and the axis of the primary shaft 121 are extended longitudinally coaxially with the longitudinal center axis of the vehicle body, and the secondary shaft 122 is disposed beside and in parallel to the primary shaft 121 on substantially the same level as the primary shaft 121, so that the primary pulley 123 and the secondary pulley 124 are on substantially the same level. As mentioned above, the front drive shaft 141 is operatively connected to the crown gear 133 at a position between the primary shaft 121 and the secondary shaft 122 below the variable-speed transmission 120 to interlock the transfer unit 140 and the variable-speed transmission 120 properly, and to form the automobile driving system in a compact construction and in a relatively small height. A pinion 141a formed in an end portion of the front drive shaft 141 is in engagement with the crown gear 133 of the front differential gear 130. A front end portion and a rear end portion of the front drive shaft 141 are supported for rotation in a taper roller bearing 141e and a needle bearing 141f on the third case 103 and the fourth case 104 of the transmission case 106, respectively. The front drive shaft 141 is provided with splines 141b to be engaged with a sun gear 143 included in a double-pinion planetary gear 142 in the circumference of a middle portion thereof, splines 141c to be engaged with a rear end portion of a hollow shaft 152 in the circumference of a rear end portion thereof, and an oil passage 141d opening at the rear end thereof and at positions on the circumference thereof respectively corresponding to an oil chamber 183A, a thrust bearing 151b and a needle bearing 182b, which will be described later. The inner ring of the taper roller bearing 141e is held between the pinion 141a and a lock nut 141g screwed on the front drive shaft 141 to restrain the front drive shaft 141 from axial movement. The double-pinion planetary gear 142 in engagement with the splines 141b formed in the circumference of the middle portion of the front drive shaft 141 comprises the sun gear 143 in engagement with the splines 141b, a ring gear 144, a first pinion 145 engaged with the ring gear 144, a second pinion 146 engaged with the sun gear 143 and the first pinion 145, and a carrier 147 supporting the first pinion 145 and the second pinion 146 for rotation in needle bearings 147a thereon. When the ring gear 144 is fastened to the transmission case 106, the sun gear 143 is rotated in the reverse direction relative to the carrier 147 by power transmitted to the carrier 147. The sun gear 143 is held between a thrust bearing 151a supported on the third case 103 of the transmission case 106 by a fixed shaft 149 fixed to the transmission case 106, a thrust bearing 149a and a hollow member 150, and a thrust bearing 151b supported on a hollow shaft 152 supported for rotation coaxially with the front drive shaft 141 in a bearing 152a on the third case 103 of the transmission case 106 to restrain the double-pinion planetary gear 142 from axial movement. The fixed shaft 149 has a substantially cylindrical shape, surrounds the front drive shaft 141, and provided at its base end with a flange, which is fastened to the case 103 of the transmission case 106 with bolts. The primary driven gear 129 engaged with the primary reduction gear 128 is supported for rotation by a needle bearing 129a on the fixed shaft 149. The primary driven gear 129 is separated by a distance L from the double-pinion planetary gear 142 to enable a third friction coupling element 568 and a fourth friction coupling element 578, which are included in an automobile driving system in a fifth embodiment according to the present invention, to be disposed between the primary driven gear 129 and the double-pinion planetary gear 142. The primary driven gear 129 and the double-pinion planetary gear 142 are interconnected by an input member consisting of a first connecting member 153a, and a second connecting member 153b, which serves also as a hub 579 included in the fourth friction coupling element 578, connected to the first connecting member 153a. A first multiple-disk clutch 155 is disposed on one side of the double-pinion planetary gear 142 opposite the other side of the same on which the input member 153 is disposed for the selective power transmission from the carrier 147 of the double-pinion planetary gear 142 to the hollow shaft 152. The first multiple-disk clutch 155 has a drum 156 engaged with the hollow shaft 152 by splines, and a hub 157 connected to the carrier 147 of the double-pinion planetary gear 142. Thus, power can be transmitted from the carrier 147 through the first multiple-disk clutch 155 to the hollow shaft 152. A retaining plate 160c contiguous with a snap ring 160d fixed to the inner circumference of the drum 156, driven plates 160b, and drive plates 160a interlocked with the hub 157 are compressed by driving a piston 159 fitted in a pressure chamber 158 by hydraulic pressure applied to the pressure chamber 158 to transmit power. A retainer 161 is disposed on one side of the piston 159 opposite the other side of the same on which the pressure chamber 158 is formed, and a return spring 163 exerts a pressure to the piston 159 to bias the piston 159. A rear end portion of the front drive shaft 141 and a rear end portion of the hollow shaft 152 are interlocked by splines 141c. A second multiple-disk clutch 165, i.e., a second friction coupling element for selectively fixing the ring gear 144 to the transmission case 106, is disposed between the third case 103 of the transmission case 106 and the double-pinion planetary gear 142. In the second multiple-disk clutch 165, a retaining plate 168c contiguous with a snap ring 168d fixed to the inner circumference of the transmission case 106, driven plates 168b, and drive plates 168a interlocked with a hub 169 mounted on the ring gear 144 are compressed by a piston 167 by applying hydraulic pressure to a pressure chamber 166 to fasten the ring gear 144 to the transmission case 106. The piston 167 is biased by return springs 170. A control valve 173 is disposed in an oil pan 172 joined to a lower portion of the transmission case 106. The control valve 173 is controlled by the hydraulic controller 138 on the basis of signals provided by the traveling speed sensor 137a, the throttle opening sensor 137b and the shift switch 137c to supply the oil discharged from the oil pump 116 selectively to the respective pressure chambers 158 and 166 of the first multiple-disk clutch 155 and the second multiple-disk clutch 165, and the variable-speed transmission 120. The operation of the automobile driving system thus constructed will be described hereinafter with reference to FIGS. 9 to 12 showing schematic views, and FIG. 13 tabulating the operating conditions of the first multiple-disk clutch 155 and the second multiple-disk clutch 165. In the table shown in FIG. 13, blank circles indicate that the corresponding multiple-disk clutches are engaged. Referring to FIG. 9, the power of the engine 110 is transmitted from the crankshaft 111 through the torque converter 113 to the primary shaft 121 of the variable-speed transmission 121. An input speed of the primary shaft 121 is converted continuously into an output speed of the secondary shaft 122 by the action of the primary pulley 123 and the secondary pulley 124 operatively connected by the drive belt 125. The output speed of the secondary shaft 122 is reduced by the action of the primary reduction gear 128 and the primary driven gear 129 and a reduced speed is transmitted through the input member 153 to the carrier 147 of the double-pinion planetary gear 142. Although both the first multiple-disk clutch 155 and the second multiple-disk clutch 165 are disengaged, the carrier 147 is driven for rotation so that the pinions 145 and 146 revolve round the sun gear when a neutral position N or a parking position P is selected, and power is not transmitted to the front drive shaft 141. When a forward range D is selected, the first multiple-disk clutch 155 is engaged to transmit driving power through a drive line indicated by thick lines in FIG. 9. A pressure is applied through the control valve 173 to the pressure chamber 158 to compress the retaining plate 160c contiguous with the snap ring 160d fixed to the inner circumference of the drum 156, the driven plates 160b and the drive plates 160a by the piston 159 so that the first multiple-disk clutch 155 is engaged. Then, the rotation of the primary driven gear 129 is transmitted through the carrier 147 of the double-pinion planetary gear 142 and the first multiple-disk clutch 155 to the hollow shaft 152, whereby the front drive shaft 141 coupled with the hollow shaft 152 by the splines is driven for rotation in the same direction as the direction in which the primary driven gear 129 is rotated to transmit power to the front differential gear 130. Since the second multiple-disk clutch 165 is disengaged to release the ring gear 144, and the carrier 147 and the front drive shaft 141 are interlocked by the first multiple-disk clutch 155 and the hollow shaft 152 as shown in FIG. 10, the double-pinion planetary gear 142 rotates together with the front drive shaft 141. When a reverse range R is selected, the first multiple-disk clutch 155 is disengaged and the second multiple-disk clutch 165 is engaged to transmit power through a drive line indicated by thick lines in FIG. 11. A pressure is applied through the control valve 173 to the pressure chamber 166 to compress the retaining plate 168c contiguous with the snap ring 168d, the driven plates 168b and the drive plates 168a by the piston 167 so that the second multiple-disk clutch 165 is engaged, whereby the ring gear 144 is restrained from rotation relative to the transmission case 106. Consequently, the first pinion 145 and the second pinion 146 rotate in the opposite directions, respectively, and revolve along the ring gear 144 as the carrier 147 of the double-pinion planetary gear 142 rotates, and thereby the sun gear 143 is rotated in a direction opposite the rotating direction of the carrier 147. Consequently, the front drive shaft 141 is driven for rotation in the reverse direction to transmit power to the front differential gear 130. The gear ratio of the double-pinion planetary gear 142 will be explained hereinafter. The gear ratio of the double-pinion planetary gear 142, i.e., the ratio of the rotating speed of the front drive shaft 141 to that of the carrier 147, is expressed by: Gear ratio=[ZS+(-ZR)]/ZS where ZS is the number of teeth of the sun gear 143, and ZR is the number of teeth of the ring gear 144. Accordingly, an optional gear ratio can be provided by properly determining ZS of the sun gear 143 and ZR of the ring gear 144. If ZS=37 and ZR=82, Gear ratio=[37+(-82)]/37=-1.216 which is an appropriate gear ratio for the reverse range R. Thus, a forward/reverse selecting mechanism comprising, as principal components, the double-pinion planetary gear 142, the first multiple-disk clutch 155 and the second multiple-disk clutch 165 is constructed. The engine 110, the torque converter 113 and the belt-drive variable-speed transmission 120 are arranged coaxially and longitudinally, and the double-pinion planetary gear 142, the first multiple-disk clutch 155 and the second multiple-disk clutch 165 constituting the forward/reverse selecting mechanism are disposed on the axis of the front drive shaft 141 disposed on a level below that of the crankshaft 111 of the engine 110 on one side of the variable-speed transmission 120 opposite the other side of the same on which the torque converter 113 is disposed. Accordingly, the upper portion of the driving system is reduced, the height of the driving system is not increased and the driving system can be made compact. An automobile driving system for a four-wheel drive vehicle, such as an automobile driving system in a fifth embodiment, comprising the same principal components as those of the automobile driving system in the first embodiment for a two-wheel drive vehicle can be constructed by additionally interposing an input selecting means between the primary driven gear 129 and the double-pinion planetary gear 142, and employing a power transfer mechanism for transferring driving force to a rear differential gear instead of the hollow shaft 152, which will be described in connection with the fifth embodiment. Second Embodiment An automobile driving system 200 in a second embodiment according to the present invention for a two-wheel drive vehicle will be described with reference to FIGS. 14 to 21. Referring to FIG. 14, in the automobile driving system 200 in the second embodiment, a torque converter case 201 joined to a longitudinal engine 210 and containing a torque converter 220, a variable-speed transmission housing 202 disposed behind the torque converter case 201 and containing a belt-drive variable-speed transmission 230 and a front differential gear 240, a case 204 disposed behind the variable-speed transmission housing 202, having a bearing plate 203, which will be described later, and containing a transfer unit 250, and an end cover 205 covering the rear end of the case 204 are arranged and joined successively in that order to construct a transmission case 206. An oil pan 207 is attached to a lower portion of the transmission case 206. The longitudinal engine 210 has a crankshaft 211 connected to a torque converter 220 contained in the torque converter case 201. An output shaft 221 included in the torque converter 220 is coupled with a primary shaft 231 included in the belt-drive variable-speed transmission 230 contained in the variable-speed transmission housing 202 to transmit power from the crankshaft 211 through the torque converter 220 to the primary shaft 231 of the variable-speed transmission 230. The variable-speed transmission 230 changes an input speed continuously to an output speed of a secondary shaft 232. The output of the secondary shaft 232 is transmitted to the transfer unit 250 contained in the case 204. The output of the transfer unit 250 is transmitted through a differential gear, for example, the front differential gear 240 to front wheels. An oil pump 208 which is driven continuously by an oil pump driving shaft 224a included in the torque converter 220 is contained in the torque converter case 201. The oil pump 208 discharges oil at a line pressure continuously to supply the oil to the torque converter 220 and associated parts, enables the hydraulic control of the variable-speed transmission 230, and enables the hydraulic control of the transfer unit 250 by a hydraulic controller 209 on the basis of signals provided by a traveling speed sensor 209a, a throttle opening sensor 209b and a shift switch 209c. The torque converter 220, the belt-drive variable-speed transmission 230, the front differential gear 240 and the transfer unit 250 will be sequentially described with reference to FIGS. 14 to 16. As shown in FIG. 15 in a sectional view, the output shaft 221 of the torque converter 220 is supported coaxially with the crankshaft 211 for rotation in ball bearings 231a on the variable-speed transmission housing 202 and the bearing plate 203. The output shaft 221 has a substantially cylindrical outer circumference and is provided at its base end with a flange rotatably surrounded by a stator shaft 222 fastened to the variable-speed transmission housing 202 with bolts. The oil pump driving shaft 224a integrally connected to an impeller 224 is fitted rotatably on the stator shaft 222. The impeller 224 is fastened with bolts to the crankshaft 211 for rotation together with the crankshaft 211 through a starter ring gear 225a having an outer circumference integrally combined with the outer circumference of a front cover 225 and formed on the outer circumference of the front cover 225, and a drive plate 226. A turbine 227 coupled by splines with the output shaft 221 is disposed opposite to the impeller 224. A stator 228 is interposed between the impeller 224 and the turbine 227 and is mounted through a one-way clutch 228a on the stator shaft 222. A lock-up clutch 229 is interposed between the turbine 227 and the front cover 225. The oil pump comprising an inner gear 208a driven for rotation by the oil pump driving shaft 224a, an outer gear engaged with the inner gear 208a, and an oil pump housing 208c is mounted on the base end of the stator shaft 222. When the crankshaft 211 rotates, the impeller 224 is driven for rotation through the drive plate 226 bolted to the crankshaft 211, the starter ring gear 225a and the front cover 225. As the impeller 224 rotates, the oil contained in the impeller 224 is discharged outside by centrifugal force, the oil flows into the turbine 227 to transmit a torque acting in the same direction as the rotating direction of the impeller 224 to the turbine 227. Consequently, the output shaft 221 coupled by splines with the turbine 227 is driven for rotation. The direction of flow of the oil flowing out from the turbine 227 is deflected by the stator 228 in a direction to assist the rotation of the impeller 224 to increase the torque of the impeller 224. If the turbine 227 rotates at a high rotating speed, the oil flows against the back surface of the stator 228 to make the stator 228 rotate on the one-way clutch 228a. When a fixed traveling speed or rotating speed is achieved, the lock-up clutch 229 engages the impeller 224 and the turbine 227 through the front cover 225 to make the torque converter operate without slipping; consequently, the operating speed of the engine 210 is reduced accordingly, whereby fuel consumption is reduced and silence is improved. The belt-drive variable-speed transmission 230 has a primary shaft 231, a secondary shaft 232 disposed in parallel to the primary shaft 231, a primary pulley 233 mounted on the primary shaft 231, a secondary pulley 234 mounted on the secondary shaft 232, and a drive belt 235 extended between the primary pulley 233 and the secondary pulley 234. The respective widths of the grooves of the primary pulley 233 and the secondary pulley 234 are varied to vary the ratio between the pitch diameters of the primary pulley 233 and the secondary pulley 234 for continuously variable speed change. The primary pulley 233 mounted on the primary shaft 231 formed integrally with the output shaft 221 has a fixed cone 233a formed integrally with the primary shaft 231 and a movable cone 233b axially movable relative to the fixed cone 233a. The fixed cone 233a and the movable cone 233b must hold the drive belt 235 by a predetermined clamping force and the width of the groove defined by the fixed cone 233a and the movable cone 233b must be smoothly controllable to ensure the smooth operation of the transmission for continuously variable speed change. Therefore, a plurality of axial grooves are formed in the mating surfaces of the primary shaft 231 and the movable cone 233b, and balls 233c are placed in the mating grooves for torque transmission. A substantially cylindrical first piston 237a is fixed to the back surface of the movable cone 233b, i.e., a surface not facing the fixed cone 233a, a pressure chamber 237A is formed by the first piston 237a and a cylinder 237b having the shape of a bottomed cylinder and having a central portion fixed to the primary shaft 231, a pressure chamber 237B is formed by fitting the opposite ends of a second piston 237d in a piston member 237c fixed to the back surface of the movable cone 233b, and the first piston 237a, and the movable cone 233b is biased toward the fixed cone 233a by a spring 237e to constitute a hydraulic actuator 237. An oil passage 231b is formed in the primary shaft 231 so as to be connected to the pressure chambers 237A and 237B. The hydraulic controller 209 executes a control operation on the basis of signals representing the opening of the throttle and such to supply the oil into and to discharge the same from the pressure chambers 237A and 237B of the hydraulic actuator 237 through an oil passage 203b formed in the bearing plate 203 and a sleeve 203c to move the movable cone 233b along the primary shaft 231 to vary the width of the groove of the pulley. The secondary shaft 232 extended in parallel to the primary shaft 231 is supported for rotation in ball bearings 232a on the variable-speed transmission housing 202 and the bearing plate 203. The secondary pulley 234 mounted on the secondary shaft 232 has a fixed cone 234a formed integrally with the secondary shaft 232, and a movable cone 234b axially movable relative to the fixed cone 234a. A plurality of axial grooves are formed in the mating surfaces of the movable cone 234b and the secondary shaft 232, and balls 234c are placed in the mating axial grooves for torque transmission. A substantially cylindrical cylinder 236a is fixed to the back surface of the movable cone 234b, a pressure chamber 236A is defined by the cylinder 236a and a cylindrical piston 236b having a central portion fixed to the secondary shaft 232, and the movable cone 234b is biased toward the fixed cone 234a by a spring 236c to constitute a hydraulic actuator 236. An oil passage 232b is formed in the secondary shaft 232 so as to be connected to the pressure chambers 236A. The hydraulic controller 209 executes a control operation on the basis of signals representing the opening of the throttle and such to supply the oil into and to discharge the same from the pressure chamber 236A of the hydraulic actuator 236 through an oil passage 204a formed in the case 204, and a sleeve 204b. A drive gear 239 is mounted on one end of the secondary shaft 232. The pressure receiving area of the movable cone 233b of the primary pulley 233 is greater than that of the movable cone 234b of the secondary pulley 234. Therefore, when the oil is supplied into and discharged from the pressure chambers 237A, 237B and 236A, the mode of variation of the width of the groove of the primary pulley 233 and that of the width of the groove of the secondary pulley 234 are reverse to each other. Thus, the ratio between the pitch diameters of the primary pulley 233 and the secondary pulley 234 is varied continuously to vary the output rotating speed of the secondary shaft 232 continuously. The front differential gear 240 is entirely the same in construction as the front differential gear 130 included in the automobile driving system in the first embodiment and having the essential portion shown in FIG. 4 in a sectional view and in FIG. 5 in a perspective view. Since the diameter of a crown gear 243 may be smaller than that of the crown gear of a conventional front differential gear, the front differential gear 240 can be formed in a small overall size, and the variable-speed transmission 230 and the front differential gear 240 can be disposed close to each other. The construction of the transfer unit will be described hereinafter with reference to FIGS. 15 and 16. As shown in FIG. 14, the transfer unit 250 has a drive shaft, for example, a front drive shaft 251, extended in parallel to the crankshaft 211 of the engine 210, the output shaft 221, the primary shaft 231 and the secondary shaft 232. The parallel arrangement of the crankshaft 211, the output shaft 221, the primary shaft 231, the secondary shaft 232 and the front drive shaft 251 as viewed in the direction of the arrow A in FIG. 15 is the same as that of the corresponding shafts of the first embodiment shown in FIG. 8. The automobile driving system is formed in a relatively small height and in a compact construction. As shown in FIG. 16, the front drive shaft 251 is provided with a pinion 251a to be engaged with the crown gear 243 of the front differential gear 240 in its front end portion, and splines 251b in its rear end portion. A front portion of the front drive shaft 251 is supported for rotation in a taper roller bearing 251d on the bearing plate 203. A parking gear 252 is mounted on a rear portion of the front drive shaft 251 in engagement with the splines 251b, and is supported for rotation in a ball bearing 252a and a needle bearing 252b on the case 204 and the end cover 205. The inner ring of the taper roller bearing 251d is held between the pinion 251a and a lock nut 251e screwed on the front drive shaft 251 to restrain the front drive shaft 251 from axial movement. The front drive shaft 251 is provided with an oil passage 251c having one end opening in the rear end of the front drive shaft 251 and the other end opening into a pressure chamber 254A and a bearing metal 256c, which will be described later. A fixed shaft 253 is held on the bearing plate 203. The fixed shaft 253 has a substantially cylindrical shape and receives a portion of the front drive shaft 251 therein. The fixed shaft 253 is provided with a flange at its base end, and the flange is fastened to the bearing plate 203 with bolts 253a. An oil seal 254 is interposed between the inner circumference of the fixed shaft 253 and the outer circumference of the front drive shaft 251 to define the pressure chamber 254A by the fixed shaft 253 and a hub 256 serving as an input member, which will be described later. The fixed shaft 253 is provided with an oil passage 253b opening into the pressure chamber 254A. The fixed shaft 253 is provided also with an oil passage 253c in its outer circumference. The hub 256 is fitted on the fixed shaft 253 and a thrust bearing 256b is interposed between the hub 256 and the fixed shaft 253. The hub 256 is substantially cylindrical, is supported at its base end for rotation by a needle bearing 257a on the fixed shaft 253, and is operatively connected to the driven gear 257 engaged with the drive gear 239 to transmit power to the driven gear 257. The end portion of the hub 256 is supported for rotation by a bearing metal 256c on the front drive shaft 251. Splines 256d are formed in the outer circumference of an end portion of the hub 256 to couple the hub 256 with a sun gear 261 included in a double-pinion planetary gear 260. The double-pinion planetary gear 260 has the sun gear 261 coupled with the hub 256 by the splines 256d, a ring gear 262, a first pinion 263 engaged with the ring gear 262. a second pinion 264 engaged with the sun gear 261 and the first pinion 263, and a carrier 265 rotatably supporting the first pinion 263 and the second pinion 264 thereon by needle bearings 265a. Power applied to the ring gear 262 is distributed to the sun gear 261 and the carrier 265 at a torque distribution ratio dependent on the dimensions of the sun gear 261 and the ring gear 262. When the ring gear 262 is fastened to the case 204, the carrier 265 is rotated by the power applied to the sun gear 261 in a direction opposite the rotating direction of the sun gear 261. The driven gear 257 is separated by a distance L from the double-pinion planetary gear 260 to enable a first multiple-disk clutch 668 and a second multiple-disk clutch 678, i.e., an input selecting means 667, included in an automobile driving system in a sixth embodiment according to the present invention, which will be described later, to be disposed between the driven gear 257 and the double-pinion planetary gear 260. A first multiple-disk clutch 270 is interposed between the driven gear 257 and the double-pinion planetary gear 260 to transmit power selectively from the driven gear 257 to the carrier 265. The first multiple-disk clutch 270 has a clutch drum 271 supported through a bushing 271a on the fixed shaft 253 and connected to the driven gear 257, and a clutch hub 272 connected to the carrier 265 of the double-pinion planetary gear 260. The first multiple-disk clutch 270 transmits power selectively from the driven gear 257 to the carrier 265. A retaining plate 275c contiguous with a snap ring 275d fixed to the inner circumference of the clutch drum 271, driven plates 275a and drive plates 275a associated with the clutch hub 272 are compressed by a piston 274 by applying pressure to a pressure chamber 273 defined by the hub 256 and the clutch drum 271 to transmit power. A retainer 276 is disposed on one side of the piston 274 opposite the other side of the same on which the pressure chamber 273 is disposed, and the pressure of a return spring 277 is exerted on the piston 274. A second multiple-disk clutch 280, i.e., a second friction coupling element, is interposed between the case 204 of the transmission case 206 and the ring gear 262 of the double-pinion planetary gear 260 to fasten the ring gear 262 selectively to the case 204. The second multiple-disk clutch 280 compresses a retaining plate 285c contiguous with a snap ring 285d fixed to the inner circumference of the case 204, driven plates 285b, and drive plates 285a associated with a clutch hub 282 connected to the ring gear 262 by applying a pressure to a piston 284 fitted in a pressure chamber 283 to fasten the ring gear 262 to the case 204. The piston 284 is biased by the pressure of a return spring 287. The carrier 265 of the double-pinion planetary gear 260 and the parking gear 252 are interlocked by a power transmission means, such as splines. A control valve 288 is disposed in the oil pan 207 joined to a lower portion of the transmission case 206. The control valve 288 is controlled by the hydraulic controller 209 on the basis of signals provided by the traveling speed sensor 209a, the throttle opening sensor 209b and the shift switch 209c to supply the oil discharged from the oil pump 208 selectively to the respective pressure chambers 273 and 283 of the first multiple-disk clutch 270 and the second multiple-disk clutch 280, and the variable-speed transmission 230. The operation of the automobile driving system thus constructed will be described hereinafter with reference to FIGS. 17 to 20, and FIG. 21 tabulating the operating conditions of the first multiple-disk clutch 270 and the second multiple-disk clutch 280. In the table shown in FIG. 21, blank circles indicate that the corresponding multiple-disk clutches are engaged. Referring to FIG. 14, the power of the engine 210 is transmitted from the crankshaft 211 through the torque converter 220 to the primary shaft 231 of the variable-speed transmission 230. An input speed of the primary shaft 231 is converted continuously into an output speed of the secondary shaft 232 by the action of the primary pulley 233 and the secondary pulley 234 operatively connected by the drive belt 235. The output speed of the secondary shaft 232 is reduced by the action of the drive gear 239 and the driven gear 257 and a reduced speed is transmitted through the clutch drum 271 to the first multiple-disk clutch 270 and through the hub 256 to the sun gear 261 of the double-pinion planetary gear 260. Although the first multiple-disk clutch 270 is disengaged and the sun gear 261 is driven for rotation by the hub 256, the first pinion 263, the second pinion 264 and the ring gear 262 idle and any power is not transmitted to the carrier 265 and beyond the carrier 265 when a neutral position N or a parking position P is selected. When a drive range D, i.e., a forward range, is selected, the first multiple-disk clutch 270 is engaged to transmit driving power through a drive line indicated by thick lines in FIG. 17. A pressure is applied through the control valve 288 to the pressure chamber 273 to compress the retaining plate 275c contiguous with the snap ring 275d fixed to the inner circumference of the clutch drum 271, the driven plates 273b and the drive plates 273a by the piston 274 so that the first multiple-disk clutch 270 is engaged. Then, the rotation of the driven gear 257 is transmitted through the carrier 265 of the double-pinion planetary gear 260 and the hub 256 to the sun gear 261, whereby the front drive shaft 251 coupled with the parking gear 257 by the splines is driven for rotation through the parking gear 252 coupled with the carrier 265 by the splines in the same direction as the direction in which the driven gear 257 is rotated to transmit power to the front differential gear 240. Therefore, the second multiple-disk clutch 280 is disengaged to release the ring gear 262 of the double-pinion planetary gear 260 as shown in FIG. 18, power is transmitted from the driven gear 257 through the first multiple-disk clutch 270 and the hub 256 to the carrier 265 and the sun gear 261 and, since the carrier 265 and the front drive shaft 251 are interlocked by the parking gear 252, the double-pinion planetary gear 260 rotates together with the front drive shaft 251. When a reverse range R is selected, the first multiple-disk clutch 270 is disengaged and the second multiple-disk clutch 280 is engaged to transmit power through a drive line indicated by thick lines in FIG. 19. A pressure is applied through the control valve 288 to the pressure chamber 283 to compress the retaining plate 285c contiguous with the snap ring 285d, the driven plates 285b and the drive plates 285a by the piston 284 so that the second multiple-disk clutch 280 is engaged, whereby the ring gear 262 is restrained from rotation relative to the case 204. Consequently, as shown in FIG. 19, the first pinion 263 and the second pinion 264 are driven by the sun gear 261 driven by the hub 256 so as to rotate in the opposite directions, respectively, and revolve along the ring gear 262 as the carrier 265 of the double-pinion planetary gear 260 rotates in a direction opposite the rotating direction of the sun gear 261. Consequently, the front drive shaft 251 is driven for rotation in the reverse direction to transmit power to the front differential gear 240. The gear ratio of the double-pinion planetary gear 260 will be explained hereinafter. The gear ratio of the double-pinion planetary gear 260, i.e., the ratio of the rotating speed of the front drive shaft 251 to that of the sun gear 261, is expressed by: Gear ratio=[ZS+(-ZR)]/ZS where ZS is the number of teeth of the sun gear 261, and ZR is the number of teeth of the ring gear 262. Accordingly, an optional gear ratio can be provided by properly determining ZS of the sun gear 261 and ZR of the ring gear 262. If Zs=37 and ZR=82, Gear ratio=[37+(-82)]/37=-1.216 which is an appropriate gear ratio for the reverse range R. Thus, a forward/reverse selecting mechanism comprising, as principal components, the double-pinion planetary gear 260, the first multiple-disk clutch 270 and the second multiple-disk clutch 280 is constructed. The engine 210, the torque converter 220 and the belt-drive variable-speed transmission 230 are arranged coaxially and longitudinally, and the double-pinion planetary gear 260, the first multiple-disk clutch 270 and the second multiple-disk clutch 280 constituting the forward/reverse selecting mechanism are disposed on the axis of the front drive shaft 251 disposed on a level below that of the crankshaft 211 of the engine 210 on one side of the variable-speed transmission 230 opposite the other side of the same on which the torque converter 220 is disposed. Accordingly, the upper portion of the driving system is reduced, the height of the driving system is not increased and the driving system can be made compact. An automobile driving system for a four-wheel drive vehicle, such as an automobile driving system in a sixth embodiment, comprising the same principal components as those of the automobile driving system in the second embodiment for a two-wheel drive vehicle can be constructed by additionally interposing an input selecting means between the driven gear 257 and the double-pinion planetary gear 260, and employing a hub and a front drive shaft for a four-wheel drive vehicle instead of the hub 256 and the front drive shaft 251, and additionally employing a power transfer mechanism for transferring driving force to a rear differential gear instead of the parking gear 252, which will be described in connection with the sixth embodiment. Third Embodiment An automobile driving system 300 in a third embodiment according to the present invention will be described hereinafter with reference to FIGS. 22 to 30. A torque converter case 301 containing a torque converter 320 and joined to a transverse engine 310, a variable-speed transmission housing 302 disposed beside the torque converter case 301 and containing a belt-drive variable-speed transmission 330 and a differential gear, for example, a front differential gear 340, a side cover 303, and an end cover 304 containing a transfer unit 350 in combination with the torque converter case 301 are arranged and joined successively to construct a transmission case 305. An oil pan, not shown, is attached to a lower portion of the transmission case 305. A crankshaft 311 included in the transverse engine 310 is connected to the torque converter 320 contained in the torque converter case 301. An output shaft 321 included in the torque converter 320 is connected to a primary shaft 331 included in the belt-drive variable-speed transmission 330 contained in the variable-speed transmission housing 302 to transmit power from the crankshaft 311 through the torque converter 320 to the primary shaft 331 of the variable-speed transmission 330. A secondary shaft 332 included in the variable-speed transmission 330 rotates at an output speed determined by varying an input speed to the variable-speed transmission 330. Power is transmitted from the secondary shaft 332 through a countershaft assembly 339 to the transfer unit 350 which in turn transmits power through the front differential gear 340 to front wheels. An oil pump 308 is disposed in the transmission case 305 and is driven continuously by an oil pump drive shaft 324a included in the torque converter 320 to discharge an oil at a line pressure. The oil is supplied to the torque converter 320, enables the hydraulic control of the variable-speed transmission 330, and enables a hydraulic controller 309 to control the transfer unit 350 on the basis of signals provided by a traveling speed sensor 309a, a throttle opening sensor 309b and a shift switch 309c. The constructions of the torque converter 320, the belt-drive variable-speed transmission 330, the differential gear 340 and the transfer unit 350 will be successively described with reference to FIGS. 23 and 24. As shown in FIG. 23 in a sectional view, the torque converter 320 has the output shaft 321 supported for rotation in ball bearings 321a on the variable-speed transmission housing 302 and the side cover 303 coaxially with the crankshaft 311. The output shaft 321 is surrounded so as to be rotatable by a stator shaft 322 having a substantially cylindrical outer circumference, and provided at its base end with a flange bolted together with an oil pump housing 308c to the torque converter case 301. The oil pump drive shaft 324a joined to an impeller 324 is fitted rotatably on the stator shaft 322. The outer circumference of the impeller 324 is joined to the outer circumference of a front cover 325 and connected by a drive plate 326 to the crankshaft 311 so as to rotate together with the crankshaft 311. A turbine 327 is disposed opposite to the impeller 324 and is coupled with the output shaft 321 by splines. A stator 328 is interposed between the impeller 324 and the turbine 327 and is supported on a one-way clutch 328a mounted on the stator shaft 322. A lock-up clutch 329 is interposed between the turbine 327 and the front cover 325. The oil pump 308 comprising an inner gear 308a driven for rotation by the oil pump drive shaft 324a, an outer gear 308b engaged with the inner gear 308a, and an oil pump housing 308c is mounted on the base end of the stator shaft 322. The rotation of the crankshaft 311 of the engine 310 is transmitted through the drive plate 326 joined to the crankshaft 311, and the front cover 325 to the impeller 324 to drive the same for rotation. As the impeller 324 rotates, the oil is discharged outside from the impeller 324 by centrifugal force, the oil flows into the turbine 327 to transmit a torque acting in the same direction as the rotating direction of the impeller 324 to the turbine 327, so that the output shaft 321 coupled by the splines with the turbine 327 is driven for rotation. The direction of flow of the oil flowing out from the turbine 327 is deflected by the stator 328 in a direction to assist the rotation of the impeller 324 to increase the torque of the impeller 324. If the turbine 327 rotates at a high rotating speed, the oil flows against the back surface of the stator 328 to make the stator 328 rotate on the one-way clutch 328a. When a fixed traveling speed or rotating speed is achieved, the lock-up clutch 329 engages the impeller 324 and the turbine 327 through the front cover 325 to make the torque converter operate without slipping; consequently, the operating speed of the engine 310 is reduced accordingly, whereby fuel consumption is reduced and silence is improved. The belt-drive variable-speed transmission 330 has a primary shaft 331, a secondary shaft 332 disposed in parallel to the primary shaft 331, a primary pulley 333 mounted on the primary shaft 331, a secondary pulley 334 mounted on the secondary shaft 332, and a drive belt 335 extended between the primary pulley 333 and the secondary pulley 334. The respective widths of the grooves of the primary pulley 333 and the secondary pulley 334 are varied to vary the ratio between the pitch diameters of the primary pulley 333 and the secondary pulley 334 for continuously variable speed change. The primary pulley 333 mounted on the primary shaft 331 formed integrally with the output shaft 321 has a fixed cone 333a formed integrally with the primary shaft 331 and a movable cone 333b axially movable relative to the fixed cone 333a. The fixed cone 333a and the movable cone 333b must hold the drive belt 335 by a predetermined clamping force and the width of the groove defined by the fixed cone 333a and the movable cone 333b must be smoothly controllable to ensure the smooth operation of the transmission for continuously variable speed change. Therefore, a plurality of axial grooves are formed in the mating surfaces of the primary shaft 331 and the movable cone 333b, and balls 333c are placed in the mating grooves for torque transmission. A substantially cylindrical piston 337a is fixed to the back surface of the movable cone 333b, i.e., a surface not facing the fixed cone 333a, a pressure chamber 337A is formed by the piston 337a and a cylinder 337b having the shape of a bottomed cylinder and having a central portion fixed to the primary shaft 331, and the movable cone 333b is biased by a spring 337c toward the fixed cone 333a to constitute a hydraulic actuator 337. An oil passage 331b is formed in the primary shaft 331 so as to be connected to the pressure chamber 337A. The hydraulic controller 309 executes a control operation on the basis of signals representing the opening of the throttle and such to supply the oil into and to discharge the same from the pressure chamber 337A of the hydraulic actuator 337 through an oil passage 303a formed in the side cover 303 to move the movable cone 333b along the primary shaft 331 to vary the width of the groove of the pulley. The secondary shaft 332 extended in parallel to the primary shaft 331 is supported for rotation in a roller bearing 332a and a ball bearing 332b on the variable-speed transmission housing 302 and the side cover 303. The secondary pulley 334 mounted on the secondary shaft 332 has a fixed cone 334a formed integrally with the secondary shaft 332, and a movable cone 334b axially movable relative to the fixed cone 334a. A plurality of axial grooves are formed in the mating surfaces of the movable cone 334b and the secondary shaft 332, and balls 334c are placed in the mating axial grooves for torque transmission from the secondary pulley 334 to the secondary shaft 332. A substantially cylindrical cylinder 336a is fixed to the back surface of the movable cone 334b, a pressure chamber 336A is defined by the cylinder 336a and a cylindrical piston 336b having a central portion fixed to the secondary shaft 332, and the movable cone 334b is biased toward the fixed cone 334a by a spring 336c to constitute a hydraulic actuator 336. An oil passage 332c is formed in the secondary shaft 332 so as to be connected to the pressure chambers 336A. The hydraulic controller 309 executes a control operation on the basis of signals representing the opening of the throttle and such to supply the oil into and to discharge the same from the pressure chamber 336A of the hydraulic actuator 336 through an oil passage 301a formed in the torque converter case 301. A drive gear 338 is mounted on one end of the secondary shaft 332. The pressure receiving area of the movable cone 333b of the primary pulley 333 is greater than that of the movable cone 334b of the secondary pulley 334. Therefore, when the oil is supplied into and discharged from the pressure chambers 337A and 336A, the mode of variation of the width of the groove of the primary pulley 333 and that of the width of the groove of the secondary pulley 334 are reverse to each other. Thus, the ratio between the pitch diameters of the primary pulley 333 and the secondary pulley 334 is varied continuously to vary the output rotating speed of the secondary shaft 332 continuously. The rotation of the secondary shaft 332 is transmitted through the drive gear 338 to the countershaft assembly 339 at a reduced rotating speed. The rotation of the countershaft assembly 339 is transmitted through a driven gear 354 and a power transmission shaft 353 connected to the driven gear 354 to the transfer unit 350. The countershaft assembly 339 comprises a shaft 339a supported for rotation at its opposite ends in a needle bearing 339e and a roller bearing 339f on the torque converter case 301 and the variable-speed transmission housing 302, a driven gear 339c fixedly mounted on the shaft 339a and engaged with the drive gear 338, and a drive gear 339d formed integrally with the shaft 339a and engaged with the driven gear 354. The respective constructions of the front differential gear 340 and the transfer unit 350 will be described hereinafter with reference to FIG. 23 and FIG. 24 showing an essential portion of a construction shown in FIG. 23 in an enlarged view. The front differential gear 340 is contained in a differential gear housing 341 formed between a driven gear 354 having a cylindrical boss 354a supported in a ball bearing 354b on the variable-speed transmission housing 302, and a substantially cylindrical transmission shaft 353 supported for rotation in a ball bearing 353a on the torque converter case 301. The front differential gear 340 has a hollow, differential gear case 342 rotatably fitted in an expanded part formed of the substantially cylindrical boss 354a of the driven gear 354 formed integrally with a front drive shaft 351, and the transmission shaft 353. A pair of pinions 343b are disposed in the differential gear case 342 and supported on a pinion shaft 343a supported at opposite ends thereof on the differential gear case 342. A left side gear 343c and a right side gear 343d are engaged with the pair of pinions 343b to constitute a differential gear 343. A drive shaft 344 connected to the side gear 343c extends through the differential gear case 342 and the variable-speed transmission housing 302, and transmits power through a constant-velocity joint and an axle to one of the front wheels. A drive shaft 345 connected to the other side gear 343d extends through the differential gear case 342 and the front drive shaft 351 formed integrally with the differential gear case 342, and transmits power through a constant-velocity joint and an axle to the other front wheel. As shown in FIG. 22, the transfer unit 350 has the front drive shaft 351 parallel to the crankshaft 311 of the engine 310, the output shaft 321, the primary shaft 321 and the secondary shaft 332. The crankshaft 311, the primary shaft 331, the secondary shaft 332 and the front drive shaft 351 extended in parallel to each other are arranged as shown in FIG. 25 in a view taken in the direction of the arrow A in FIG. 23; the crankshaft 311 having an axis 311a of rotation and the primary shaft 331 are extended coaxially along the width of the vehicle body, the secondary shaft 332 is disposed behind and in parallel to the primary shaft 331 on a level higher than that of the primary shaft 331, the secondary pulley 334 is disposed opposite to the primary pulley 333, and the front drive shaft 351 is disposed below and in parallel to the secondary shaft 332. Thus, the driving system is formed in a compact construction having relatively small transverse and longitudinal dimensions to facilitate the installation of the driving system in the engine room and to improve the compatibility of the driving system with both a vehicle body designed to be mounted with a manual transmission (MT) and a vehicle body designed to be mounted with an automatic transmission (AT). The front drive shaft 351 formed integrally with the differential gear case 342 has one end rotatably supported through the transmission shaft 354 and the ball bearing 353a supporting the transmission shaft 353 on the torque converter case 301, and the other end rotatably supported in a needle bearing 351c on the end cover 304. The front drive shaft 351 is provided in a middle portion thereof with splines 351a which engage with the sun gear 356 of the double-pinion planetary gear 355, and splines 351b which engage with a clutch drum 366 included in a first multiple-disk clutch 365, i.e., a first friction coupling element, in a portion thereof near the splines 351a. The double-pinion planetary gear 355 mounted on the middle portion provided with the splines 351a of the front drive shaft 351 has a sun gear 356 engaged with the splines 351a, a ring gear 357, a first pinion 358 engaged with the ring gear 357, a second pinion 359 engaged with the first pinion 358 and the sun gear 357, and a carrier 360 supporting the first pinion 358 and the second pinion 359 for rotation thereon in needle bearings 360a. If the ring gear 357 is fastened to the transmission case 305, the sun gear 356 rotates in a direction reverse to the rotating direction of the carrier 360. The double-pinion planetary gear 355 is restrained from axial movement by holding the sun gear 356 between a thrust bearing 356a, and a thrust bearing 356b supported through the clutch drum 366 on the end cover 304. The transmission shaft 353 is operatively connected to the carrier 360 of the double-pinion planetary gear 355 by a connecting member 361 having one end engaged with the transmission shaft 353 by splines, and a coupling member 362, which corresponds to a clutch hub 779 included in a second multiple-disk clutch 778 employed in a seventh embodiment. The transmission shaft 353 and the connecting member 361 constitute an input member 363. The connecting member 361 is supported for rotation on a thrust bearing 364a supported on a substantially cylindrical fixed shaft 364 formed integrally with the torque converter case 301. The first multiple-disk clutch 365 serves as a first friction coupling element for selectively connecting the front drive shaft 351 and the carrier 360 of the double-pinion planetary gear 355 for power transmission, and a second multiple-disk clutch 375 serves as a second friction coupling element for selectively fastening the ring gear of the double-pinion planetary gear 355 to the transmission case 305. In the first multiple-disk clutch 365, the clutch drum is engaged with the front drive shaft 351 by the splines 351b, and a clutch hub 367 is connected to the carrier 360 of the double-pinion planetary gear 355 to enable the connection of the front drive shaft 351 and the carrier 360 for power transmission. A retaining plate 370c contiguous with a snap ring 370d fixed to the inner circumference of the clutch drum 366, driven plates 370b, and drive plates 370a associated with the clutch hub 367 are compressed by a piston 369 by a pressure applied to a pressure chamber 368 to transmit power. A pressure is exerted on the piston 369 by a return spring 373. The second multiple-disk clutch 375 fastens the ring gear 357 to the transmission case 305 when a retaining plate 380c contiguous with a snap ring 380d fixed to the inner circumference of the end case 304, driven plates 380b, and drive plates 380a associated with the clutch hub 377 are compressed by a piston 379 by a pressure applied to a pressure chamber 378. A pressure is exerted on the piston 369 by a return spring 383. A control valve is disposed in the oil pan joined to a lower portion of the transmission case 305. The control valve is controlled by the hydraulic controller 309 on the basis of signals provided by the traveling speed sensor 309a, the throttle opening sensor 309b and the shift switch 309c to supply the oil discharged from the oil pump selectively to the respective pressure chambers 368 and 378 of the first multiple-disk clutch 365 and the second multiple-disk clutch 375, and the variable-speed transmission 330. The operation of the automobile driving system for a two-wheel drive vehicle thus constructed will be described with reference to FIGS. 28 and 29, and FIG. 30 tabulating the operating conditions of the first multiple-disk clutch 365 and the second multiple-disk clutch 375. In the table shown in FIG. 30, blank circles indicate that the corresponding multiple-disk clutches are engaged. The power of the engine 310 is transmitted from the crankshaft 311 through the torque converter 320 to the primary shaft 331 of the variable-speed transmission 330. An input speed of the primary shaft 331 is converted continuously into an output speed of the secondary shaft 332 by the action of the primary pulley 333 and the secondary pulley 334 operatively connected by the drive belt 335. The output speed of the secondary shaft 332 is reduced by the action of the drive gear 338, the countershaft assembly 339 and the driven gear 354 and a reduced speed is transmitted through the connecting member 361 to the carrier 360 of the double-pinion planetary gear 355. Although both the first multiple-disk clutch 365 and the second multiple-disk clutch 375 are disengaged and the carrier 360 rotates, and the first pinion 358 and the second pinion 359 revolve round the sun gear 356, any power is not transmitted to and beyond the front drive shaft 351 when a neutral position N or a parking position P is selected. When a drive range D, i.e., a forward range, is selected, the first multiple-disk clutch 365 is engaged to transmit driving power through a drive line indicated by thick lines in FIG. 26. A pressure is applied through the control valve to the pressure chamber 368 to compress the retaining plate 370c contiguous with the snap ring 370d fixed to the inner circumference of the clutch drum 366, the driven plates 370b, and the drive plates 370a associated with the clutch hub 367 by the piston 369 so that the first multiple-disk clutch 365 is engaged. Then, the rotation of the transmission shaft 353 is transmitted through the carrier 360 of the double-pinion planetary gear 355 and the first multiple-disk clutch 365 to the front drive shaft 351, whereby the front drive shaft 351c is rotated in the same direction as the rotating direction of the transmission shaft 353 to transmit power to the front differential gear 340. The second multiple-disk clutch 375 is disengaged to release the ring gear 357 of the double-pinion planetary gear 355 as shown in FIG. 27, and the first multiple-disk clutch 365 is engaged to operatively connect the carrier 360 to the front drive shaft 351, so that the double-pinion planetary gear 355 rotates together with the drive shaft 351. When a reverse range R is selected, the first multiple-disk clutch 365 is disengaged and the second multiple-disk clutch 375 is engaged to transmit power through a drive line indicated by thick lines in FIG. 28. A pressure is applied through the control valve to the pressure chamber 378 to compress the retaining plate 380c contiguous with the snap ring 380d, the drive plates 380a and the driven plates 380b by the piston 379 so that the second multiple-disk clutch 375 is engaged, whereby the ring gear 375 is restrained from rotation relative to the transmission case 305. Consequently, as shown in FIG. 29, the first pinion 358 and the second pinion 359 rotate in the opposite directions, respectively, and revolve along the ring gear 357 to rotate the sun gear 356 in a direction opposite the rotating direction of the carrier 360. Consequently, the front drive shaft 351 is driven for rotation in the reverse direction to transmit power to the front differential gear 340. The gear ratio of the double-pinion planetary gear 355 will be explained hereinafter. The gear ratio of the double-pinion planetary gear 355, i.e., the ratio of the rotating speed of the front drive shaft 351 to that of the carrier 360, is expressed by: Gear ratio=[ZS+(-ZR)]/ZS where ZS is the number of teeth of the sun gear 356, and ZR is the number of teeth of the ring gear 357. Accordingly, an optional gear ratio can be provided by properly determining ZS of the sun gear 356 and ZR of the ring gear 357. If Zs=37 and ZR=82, Gear ratio=[37+(-82)]/37=-1.216 which is an appropriate gear ratio for the reverse range R. Thus, a forward/reverse selecting mechanism comprising, as principal components, the double-pinion planetary gear 355, the first multiple-disk clutch 365 and the second multiple-disk clutch 375 is constructed. The engine 310, the torque converter 320 and the belt-drive variable-speed transmission 330 are arranged coaxially and transversely, and the double-pinion planetary gear 355, the first multiple-disk clutch 365 and the second multiple-disk clutch 375 constituting the forward/reverse selecting mechanism are disposed on the axis of the front drive shaft 351 disposed on a level below that of the crankshaft 311 of the engine 310 and on one side of the transmission 330 opposite the other side of the same on which the torque converter 320 is disposed. Accordingly, the upper portion of the driving system is reduced, the height of the driving system is not increased, the driving system can be made compact, the degree of freedom of vehicle body design is increased, and a space for securing crush stroke and work for mounting and dismounting the transmission can be easily secured. An automobile driving system for a four-wheel drive vehicle, such as an automobile driving system in a seventh embodiment, comprising the same principal components as those of the automobile driving system in the third embodiment for a two-wheel drive vehicle can be constructed by employing an input selecting means instead of the connecting member 361 of the foregoing driving system for a two-wheel drive vehicle, and additionally employing a power transfer mechanism for transferring driving force to a rear differential gear, which will be described in connection with the seventh embodiment. Fourth Embodiment An automobile driving system 400 in a fourth embodiment according to the present invention will be described hereinafter with reference to FIGS. 31 to 38. A torque converter case 401 containing a torque converter 420 and joined to a transverse engine 410, a variable-speed transmission housing 402 disposed beside the torque converter case 401 and containing a belt-drive variable-speed transmission 430 and a differential gear, for example, a front differential gear 440, a side cover 403, and an end cover 404 containing a transfer unit 450 in combination with the torque converter case 401 are arranged and joined successively to construct a transmission case 405. An oil pan, not shown, is attached to a lower portion of the transmission case 405. A crankshaft 411 included in the transverse engine 410 is connected to the torque converter 420 contained in the torque converter case 401. An output shaft 421 included in the torque converter 420 is connected to a primary shaft 431 included in the belt-drive variable-speed transmission 430 contained in the variable-speed transmission housing 402 to transmit power from the crankshaft 411 through the torque converter 420 to the primary shaft 431 of the variable-speed transmission 430. A secondary shaft 432 included in the variable-speed transmission 430 rotates at an output speed determined by varying an input speed to the variable-speed transmission 430. Power is transmitted from the secondary shaft 432 through a countershaft assembly 439 to the transfer unit 450 which in turn transmits power through the front differential gear 440 to front wheels. An oil pump 408 is disposed in the transmission case 405 and is driven continuously by an oil pump drive shaft 424a included in the torque converter 420 to discharge an oil at a line pressure. The oil is supplied to the torque converter 420, enables the hydraulic control of the variable-speed transmission 430, and enables a hydraulic controller 409 to control the transfer unit 450 on the basis of signals provided by a traveling speed sensor 409a, a throttle opening sensor 409b and a shift switch 409c. The constructions of the torque converter 420, the belt-drive variable-speed transmission 430, the front differential gear 440 and the transfer unit 450 will be successively described with reference to FIGS. 31 to 33. As shown in FIG. 32 in a sectional view, the torque converter 420 has the output shaft 421 supported for rotation in ball bearings 421a on the variable-speed transmission housing 402 and the side cover 403 coaxially with the crankshaft 411. The output shaft 421 is surrounded so as to be rotatable by a stator shaft 422 having a substantially cylindrical outer circumference, and provided at its base end with a flange bolted together with an oil pump housing 408c to the torque converter case 401. The oil pump drive shaft 424a joined to an impeller 424 is fitted rotatably on the stator shaft 422. The outer circumference of the impeller 424 is joined to the outer circumference of a front cover 425 and connected by a drive plate 426 to the crankshaft 411 so as to rotate together with the crankshaft 411. A turbine 427 is disposed opposite to the impeller 424 and is coupled with the output shaft 421 by splines. A stator 428 is interposed between the impeller 424 and the turbine 427 and is supported on a one-way clutch 428a mounted on the stator shaft 422. A lock-up clutch 429 is interposed between the turbine 427 and the front cover 425. The oil pump 408 comprising an inner gear 408a driven for rotation by the oil pump drive shaft 424a, an outer gear 408b engaged with the inner gear 408a, and an oil pump housing 408c is mounted on the base end of the stator shaft 422. The rotation of the crankshaft 411 of the engine 410 is transmitted through the drive plate 426 joined to the crankshaft 411, and the front cover 425 to the impeller 424 to drive the same for rotation. As the impeller 424 rotates, the oil is discharged outside from the impeller 424 by centrifugal force, the oil flows into the turbine 427 to transmit a torque acting in the same direction as the rotating direction of the impeller 424 to the turbine 427, so that the output shaft 421 coupled by the splines with the turbine 427 is driven for rotation. The direction of flow of the oil flowing out from the turbine 427 is deflected by the stator 428 in a direction to assist the rotation of the impeller 424 to increase the torque of the impeller 424. If the turbine 427 rotates at a high rotating speed, the oil flows against the back surface of the stator 428 to make the stator 428 rotate freely on the one-way clutch 428a. When a fixed traveling speed or rotating speed is achieved, the lock-up clutch 429 engages the impeller 424 and the turbine 427 through the front cover 425 to make the torque converter operate without slipping; consequently, the operating speed of the engine 410 is reduced accordingly, whereby fuel consumption is reduced and silence is improved. The belt-drive variable-speed transmission 430 has a primary shaft 431, a secondary shaft 432 disposed in parallel to the primary shaft 431, a primary pulley 433 mounted on the primary shaft 431, a secondary pulley 434 mounted on the secondary shaft 432, and a drive belt 435 extended between the primary pulley 433 and the secondary pulley 434. The respective widths of the grooves of the primary pulley 433 and the secondary pulley 434 are varied to vary the ratio between the pitch diameters of the primary pulley 433 and the secondary pulley 434 for continuously variable speed change. The primary pulley 433 mounted on the primary shaft 431 formed integrally with the output shaft 421 has a fixed cone 433a formed integrally with the primary shaft 431 and a movable cone 433b axially movable relative to the fixed cone 433a. The fixed cone 433a and the movable cone 433b must hold the drive belt 435 by a predetermined clamping force and the width of the groove defined by the fixed cone 433a and the movable cone 433b must be smoothly controllable to ensure the smooth operation of the transmission for continuously variable speed change. Therefore, a plurality of axial grooves are formed in the mating surfaces of the primary shaft 431 and the movable cone 433b, and balls 433c are placed in the mating grooves for torque transmission. A substantially cylindrical piston 437a is fixed to the back surface of the movable cone 433b, i.e., a surface not facing the fixed cone 433a, a pressure chamber 437A is formed by the piston 437a and a cylinder 437b having the shape of a bottomed cylinder and having a central portion fixed to the primary shaft 431, and the movable cone 433b is biased by a spring 437c toward the fixed cone 433a to constitute a hydraulic actuator 437. An oil passage 431b is formed in the primary shaft 431 so as to be connected to the pressure chamber 437A. The hydraulic controller 409 executes a control operation on the basis of signals representing the opening of the throttle and such to supply the oil into and to discharge the same from the pressure chamber 437A of the hydraulic actuator 437 through an oil passage 303a formed in the side cover 403 to move the movable cone 433b along the primary shaft 431 to vary the width of the groove of the pulley. The secondary shaft 432 extended in parallel to the primary shaft 431 is supported for rotation in a roller bearing 432a and a ball bearing 432b on the variable-speed transmission housing 402 and the side cover 403. The secondary pulley 434 mounted on the secondary shaft 432 has a fixed cone 434a formed integrally with the secondary shaft 432, and a movable cone 434b axially movable relative to the fixed cone 434a. A plurality of axial grooves are formed in the mating surfaces of the movable cone 434b and the secondary shaft 432, and balls 434c are placed in the mating axial grooves for torque transmission from the secondary pulley 434 to the secondary shaft 432. A substantially cylindrical cylinder 436a is fixed to the back surface of the movable cone 434b, a pressure chamber 436A is defined by the cylinder 436a and a cylindrical piston 436b having a central portion fixed to the secondary shaft 432, and the movable cone 434b is biased toward the fixed cone 434a by a spring 436c to constitute a hydraulic actuator 436. An oil passage 432c is formed in the secondary shaft 432 so as to be connected to the pressure chambers 436A. The hydraulic controller 409 executes a control operation on the basis of signals representing the opening of the throttle and such to supply the oil into and to discharge the same from the pressure chamber 436A of the hydraulic actuator 436 through an oil passage 403b formed in the side cover 403. A drive gear 438 is mounted on one end of the secondary shaft 432. The pressure receiving area of the movable cone 433b of the primary pulley 433 is greater than that of the movable cone 434b of the secondary pulley 434. Therefore, when the oil is supplied into and discharged from the pressure chambers 437A and 436A, the mode of variation of the width of the groove of the primary pulley 433 and that of the width of the groove of the secondary pulley 434 are reverse to each other. Thus, the ratio between the pitch diameters of the primary pulley 433 and the secondary pulley 434 is varied continuously to vary the output rotating speed of the secondary shaft 432 continuously. The rotation of the secondary shaft 432 is transmitted through the drive gear 438 to the countershaft assembly 439 at a reduced rotating speed. The rotation of the countershaft assembly 439 is transmitted through a driven gear 454 and a power transmission shaft 453 bolted to the driven gear 454 to the transfer unit 450. The countershaft assembly 439 comprises a shaft 439a supported for rotation at its opposite ends in a needle bearing 339e and a roller bearing 339f on the torque converter case 401 and the variable-speed transmission housing 402, a driven gear 439c fixedly mounted on the shaft 439a for rotation together with the shaft 439a and engaged with the drive gear 438, and a drive gear 439d formed integrally with the drive shaft 439a and engaged with the driven gear 454. The respective constructions of the front differential gear 440 and the transfer unit 450 will be described hereinafter with reference to FIG. 32 and FIG. 33 showing an essential portion of a construction shown in FIG. 32 in an enlarged view. The front differential gear 440 is contained in a differential gear housing 441 formed between a driven gear 454 having a cylindrical boss 454a supported in a ball bearing 454b on the variable-speed transmission housing 402, and a substantially cylindrical transmission shaft 453 supported for rotation in a ball bearing 453a on the torque converter case 401. The front differential gear 440 has a hollow, differential gear case 442 rotatably fitted in an expanded part formed of the substantially cylindrical boss 454a of the driven gear 454 formed integrally with a front drive shaft 451, and the transmission shaft 453. A pair of pinions 443b are disposed in the differential gear case 442 and supported on a pinion shaft 443a supported at opposite ends thereof on the differential gear case 442. A left side gear 443c and a right side gear 443d are engaged with the pair of pinions 343b to constitute a differential gear 443. A drive shaft 444 connected to the side gear 443c extends through the differential gear case 442 and the variable-speed transmission housing 402, and transmits power through a constant-velocity joint and an axle to one of the front wheels. A drive shaft 445 connected to the other side gear 443d extends through the differential gear case 442 and the front drive shaft 451 formed integrally with the differential gear case 442, and transmits power through a constant-velocity joint and an axle to the other front wheel. The transfer unit 450 has the front drive shaft 451 parallel to the crankshaft 411 of the engine 410, the output shaft 421, the primary shaft 431 and the secondary shaft 432. The arrangement of the crankshaft 411, the primary shaft 431, the secondary shaft 432 and the front drive shaft 451 extended in parallel to each other is the same as that of the corresponding shafts of the third embodiment previously described with reference to FIG. 25. Thus, the driving system is formed in a compact construction having a relatively small longitudinal dimension to facilitate the installation of the driving system in the engine room and to improve the compatibility of the driving system with both a vehicle body designed to be mounted with a manual transmission (MT) and a vehicle body designed to be mounted with an automatic transmission (AT). The front drive shaft 451 formed integrally with the differential gear case 442 has one end rotatably supported through the transmission shaft 453 and the ball bearing 453a supporting the transmission shaft 453 on the torque converter case 401, and the other end rotatably supported in a needle bearing 451c on the end cover 404. The front drive shaft 451 is provided in a middle portion thereof with splines 451a which engage with a hub 452, which will be mentioned later, and splines 451b which engage with a carrier 460 included in a double-pinion planetary gear 455 in a portion thereof near the splines 451a. The front drive shaft 451 is inserted in a substantially cylindrical fixed shaft 462 formed integrally with torque converter case 401. A space between an end surface of the fixed shaft 462 and the front drive shaft 451 is closed by the hub 452 to form a pressure chamber 462A. The fixed shaft 462 is provided with an oil passage 462a connected to the pressure chamber 462A, and an oil passage 462b formed in its outer circumference. The hub 452, i.e., an input member, is rotatably mounted on the front drive shaft 451. The hub 452 has a cylindrical portion 452a fitted on the front drive shaft 451, a flange 452b formed at the base end of the cylindrical portion 452a, provided with splines 452c which engage with the sun gear 456 of the double-pinion planetary gear 455 in its outer circumference and splines which engage with the splines 451a of the front drive shaft 451 in its inner circumference. A clutch drum 466 included in a first multiple-disk clutch 465, i.e., a first friction coupling element, is connected to the flange 452b. The hub 452 is engaged with splines formed in an end portion of the transmission shaft 453 and is supported for rotation by a thrust bearing 452d on the fixed shaft 462. The double-pinion planetary gear 455 has a sun gear 456 engaged with the splines 452c of the hub 452, a ring gear 457, a first pinion 458 engaged with the ring gear 457, a second pinion 459 engaged with the sun gear 456 and the first pinion 458, and a carrier 460 supporting the first pinion 458 and the second pinion 459 for rotation thereon in needle bearings 460a. If the ring gear 457 is fastened to the end cover 404, the carrier 460 is rotated in a direction opposite the rotating direction of the sun gear 456 at a reduced rotating speed by power transmitted to the sun gear 456. The carrier 460 is engaged with an output power transmitting means, for example, the splines 451b of the drive shaft 451, for power transmission. The first multiple-disk clutch 465, i.e., a first friction coupling element for selectively transmitting power from the transmission shaft 453 to the carrier 460, is interposed between the transmission shaft 453 and the double-pinion planetary gear 455. In the first multiple-disk clutch 465, the hub 452 is supported for rotation on the fixed shaft 462, the clutch drum 466 is fitted in and operatively connected to the hub 452, and a clutch hub 467 is connected to the carrier 460 of the double-pinion planetary gear 455. The first multiple-disk clutch 465 connects the transmission shaft 453 and the carrier 460 for power transmission. The first multiple-disk clutch 465 compresses a retaining plate 470c contiguous with a snap ring 470d fixed to the inner circumference of the clutch drum 466, driven plates 470b, and drive plates 470a associated with a clutch hub 467 by applying a pressure to a piston 469 fitted in a pressure chamber 468 to transmit power. A retainer 472 is disposed on one side of the piston 469 opposite the other side of the same on which the pressure chamber 468 is disposed, and the piston 469 is biased by the pressure of a return spring 473. A second multiple-disk clutch 475, i.e., a second friction coupling means for selectively fastening the ring gear 457 to the end cover 404, is interposed between the end cover 404 of the transmission cover 405 and the ring gear 457. In the second multiple-disk clutch 475, a retaining plate 480c contiguous with a snap ring 480d fixed to the inner circumference of the end cover 404, driven plates 480b, and drive plates 480a associated with a clutch hub 477 connected to the ring gear 457 are compressed by a piston 479 driven by a pressure applied to a pressure chamber 478 to fasten the ring gear 457 to the end cover 404. The piston 479 is biased by the pressure of a return spring 483. A control valve is disposed in the oil pan joined to a lower portion of the transmission case 405. The control valve is controlled by the hydraulic controller 409 on the basis of signals provided by the traveling speed sensor 409a, the throttle opening sensor 409b and the shift switch 409c to supply the oil discharged from the oil pump selectively to the respective pressure chambers 468 and 478 of the first multiple-disk clutch 465 and the second multiple-disk clutch 475, and the variable-speed transmission 430. The operation of the automobile driving system for a two-wheel drive vehicle thus constructed will be described with reference to FIGS. 34 to 37, and FIG. 38 tabulating the operating conditions of the first multiple-disk clutch 465 and the second multiple-disk clutch 475. In the table shown in FIG. 38, blank circles indicate that the corresponding multiple-disk clutches are engaged. The power of the engine 410 is transmitted from the crankshaft 411 through the torque converter 420 to the primary shaft 431 of the variable-speed transmission 430. An input speed of the primary shaft 431 is converted continuously into an output speed of the secondary shaft 432 by the action of the primary pulley 433 and the secondary pulley 434 operatively connected by the drive belt 435. The output speed of the secondary shaft 432 is reduced by the action of the drive gear 438, the countershaft assembly 439 and the driven gear 454 and a reduced speed is transmitted through the transmission shaft 453 and the hub 452, i.e., an input member, to the first multiple-disk clutch 465 and the sun gear 456 of the double-pinion planetary gear 455. The first multiple-disk clutch 465 and the second multiple-disk clutch 475 are disengaged and power is not transmitted beyond the first multiple-disk clutch 465 and the second multiple-disk clutch 475 when a neutral position N or a parking position P is selected. When a drive range D, i.e., a forward range, is selected, the first multiple-disk clutch 465 is engaged to transmit driving power through a drive line indicated by thick lines in FIG. 34. A pressure is applied through the control valve to the pressure chamber 468 to compress the retaining plate 470c contiguous with the snap ring 470d fixed to the inner circumference of clutch drum 466, the driven plates 470b, and the drive plates 470a by the piston 469 so that the first multiple-disk clutch 465 is engaged. Then, power is transmitted from the driven gear 454 through the transmission shaft 453 and the hub 452 to the carrier 460 of the double-pinion planetary gear 455 to drive the front drive shaft 451 coupled with the carrier 460 by the splines for rotation in the same direction as the rotating direction of the driven gear 454 to transmit power to the front differential gear 440. The second multiple-disk clutch 475 is disengaged to release the ring gear 457 of the double-pinion planetary gear 455 as shown in FIG. 35. Since the carrier 460 is coupled with the front drive shaft 451 by the splines, the double-pinion planetary gear 455 rotates together with the drive shaft 451. When a reverse range R is selected, the first multiple-disk clutch 465 is disengaged and the second multiple-disk clutch 475 is engaged to transmit power through a drive line indicated by thick lines in FIG. 36. A pressure is applied through the control valve to the pressure chamber 478 to compress the retaining plate 480c contiguous with the snap ring 480d, the drive plates 480a and the driven plates 480b by the piston 479 to engage the second multiple-disk clutch 375, whereby the ring gear 475 is restrained from rotation relative to the transmission case 405 to transmit power from the transmission shaft 453 through the hub 452 to the sun gear 456 of the double-pinion planetary gear 455. Consequently, as shown in FIG. 37, the first pinion 458 and the second pinion 459 rotate in the opposite directions, respectively, and revolve along the ring gear 457 to rotate the carrier 460 in a direction opposite the rotating direction of the sun gear 456. Consequently, the front drive shaft 451 is driven for rotation in the reverse direction to transmit power to the front differential gear 440. The gear ratio of the double-pinion planetary gear 455 will be explained hereinafter. The gear ratio of the double-pinion planetary gear 455, i.e., the ratio of the rotating speed of the carrier 460 to that of the sun gear 456, i.e., the ratio of the rotating speed of the front drive shaft 451 to that of the sun gear 456, is expressed by: Gear ratio=[ZS+(-ZR)]/ZS where ZS is the number of teeth of the sun gear 456, and ZR is the number of teeth of the ring gear 457. Accordingly, an optional gear ratio can be provided by properly determining ZS of the sun gear 456 and ZR of the ring gear 457. If ZS=37 and ZR=82, Gear ratio=[37+(-82)]/37=-1.216 which is an appropriate gear ratio for the reverse range R. Thus, a forward/reverse selecting mechanism comprising, as principal components, the double-pinion planetary gear 455, the first multiple-disk clutch 465 and the second multiple-disk clutch 475 is constructed. The engine 410, the torque converter 420 and the belt-drive variable-speed transmission 430 are arranged coaxially and transversely, and the double-pinion planetary gear 455, the first multiple-disk clutch 465 and the second multiple-disk clutch 475 constituting the forward/reverse selecting mechanism are disposed on the axis of the front drive shaft 451 disposed on a level below that of the crankshaft 411 of the engine 410. Accordingly, the upper portion of the driving system is reduced, the height of the driving system is not increased, the driving system can be made compact, the degree of freedom of vehicle body design is increased, and a space for securing crush stroke and work for mounting and dismounting the transmission can be easily secured. An automobile driving system for a four-wheel drive vehicle, such as an automobile driving system in an eighth embodiment, comprising the same principal components as those of the automobile driving system in the fourth embodiment for a two-wheel drive vehicle can be constructed by interposing an input selecting means between the transmission shaft 453 and the double-pinion planetary gear 455, employing a hub and a front drive shaft for a four-wheel drive vehicle instead of the hub and the front drive shaft 451, and additionally including a power transfer mechanism for transferring power to a rear differential gear, which will be described in connection with the eighth embodiment. Fifth Embodiment An automobile driving system 500 in a fifth embodiment according to the present invention for a four-wheel drive vehicle will be described hereinafter with reference to FIG. 39 to 48. Referring to FIG. 39, in the automobile driving system 500 in the fifth embodiment for a four-wheel drive vehicle, a first case 501 joined to a longitudinal engine, a second case 502 disposed behind the first case 501 and containing a belt-drive variable-speed transmission 520, a third case 503 disposed behind the second case 502 and containing a transfer unit 550, and a fourth case 504 disposed behind the third case 503 an d containing a power transmitting mechanism for transmitting the output of the transfer unit 550 to rear wheels are arranged and joined successively in that order. A fifth case 505 containing a front differential gear 530 is joined to a lower portion of the second case 502 to construct a transmission case 506. An oil pan is attached to a lower portion of the transmission case 506. The longitudinal engine 510 has a crankshaft 511 connected to a torque converter 513 provided with a lock-up clutch 512 and contained in the first case 501. An output shaft 514 associated with the torque converter 513 is coupled with a primary shaft 521 included in the belt-drive variable-speed transmission 520 contained in the second case 502. The output shaft 514 included in the torque converter 513 and the primary shaft 521 are coaxial with the crankshaft 511 of the engine 510, and are supported for rotation in bearings on the transmission case 506. The variable-speed transmission 520 has a secondary shaft 522 disposed beside and in parallel to the primary shaft 521. A primary pulley 523 and a secondary pulley 524 are mounted on the primary shaft 521 and the secondary shaft 522, respectively. The width of the groove of the primary pulley 523 is varied by a primary cylinder actuator 526, and the width of the groove of the secondary pulley 524 is varied by a secondary cylinder actuator 527. A drive belt 525 is extended between the primary pulley 523 and the secondary pulley 524. A hydraulic control system varies the width of the groove between the movable and fixed cones of the primary pulley 523 and the secondary pulley 524 to vary the ratio between the pitch diameters of the primary pulley 523 and the secondary pulley 524, whereby the rotating speed of the secondary shaft 522 is varied continuously. A primary reduction gear 528 is mounted on the secondary shaft 524 and power is transmitted through a primary driven gear 529 engaged with the primary reduction gear 528 to the transfer unit 550 contained in the third case 503 and the fourth case 504. An output driving force of the transfer unit 550 is transmitted through a differential gear, for example, the front differential gear 530 to front wheels, and through a propeller shaft 537 and another differential gear, for example, a rear differential gear 538, to rear wheels. The front differential gear 530 is entirely the same in construction as the front differential gear 130 employed in the first embodiment previously described with reference to FIGS. 3 and 4. Therefore, a crown gear 533 may be of a small diameter, the front differential gear 530 can be formed in a relatively small overall size, and the variable-speed transmission 520 and the front differential gear 530 can be disposed close to each other. As shown in FIG. 39, an oil pump 516 which is driven continuously by a stator shaft 515 included in the torque converter 513 is contained in the second case 502. The oil pump 516 discharges oil at a line pressure continuously to supply the oil to the torque converter 513 and associated parts, enables the hydraulic control of the variable-speed transmission 520, and enables the hydraulic control of the transfer unit 550 by a hydraulic controller 547 on the basis of signals provided by a traveling speed sensor 541, a throttle opening sensor 542, a shift switch 543, a front wheel speed sensor 544, a rear wheel speed sensor 545 and a steering angle sensor 546. The construction of the transfer unit 550 will be described with reference to FIGS. 40 and 41. The transfer unit 550 has a front drive shaft 551, i.e., a first drive shaft, and a rear drive shaft 552, i.e., a second drive shaft, which are extended in parallel to the crankshaft 511 of the engine 510, the output shaft 514, the primary shaft 521 and the secondary shaft 522. As shown in FIG. 42, i.e., a view taken in the direction of the arrow A in FIG. 40, the crankshaft 511, the primary shaft 521, the secondary shaft 522, the front drive shaft 551 and the rear drive shaft 552 are extended in parallel to each other. The axis 511a of rotation of the crankshaft 511 and the axis of the primary shaft 521 are extended longitudinally and are coaxial with the longitudinal center axis of the vehicle body, and the primary shaft 521 and the secondary shaft 522 are disposed in parallel to each other on substantially the same level, so that the primary pulley 523 and the secondary pulley 524 are on substantially the same level. As mentioned above, the front drive shaft 551 is operatively connected to the crown gear 533 at a position between the primary shaft 521 and the secondary shaft 522 below the variable-speed transmission 520 to interlock the transfer unit 540 and the variable-speed transmission 520 properly, and to form the automobile driving system in a compact construction and in a relatively small height. The rear drive shaft 522 is disposed below the primary shaft 521 with their axes included in a vertical plane, to facilitate the insertion of the automobile driving system in a tunnel 549 and to improve the compatibility of the driving system with both a vehicle body designed to be mounted with a manual transmission and a vehicle body designed to be mounted with an automatic transmission. A pinion 551a formed in an end portion of the front drive shaft 551 is in engagement with a crown gear 533 included in the front differential gear 530. A front end portion and a rear end portion of the front drive shaft 551 are supported for rotation in a taper roller bearing 551e and a needle bearing 551f on the third case 503 and the fourth case 504 of the transmission case 506, respectively. The front drive shaft 551 is provided with splines 551b to be engaged with a sun gear 556 included in a double-pinion planetary gear 555 in the circumference of a middle portion thereof, splines 551c to be engaged with drum 594 included in a fourth multiple-disk clutch 593, i.e., a fourth friction coupling element, in the circumference of an end portion thereof, and an oil passage 551d opening at the rear end thereof and at positions on the circumference thereof respectively corresponding to an oil chamber 565A, a radial bearing 561b and a needle bearing 582b, which will be described later. The inner ring of the taper roller bearing 551e is held between the pinion 551a and a lock nut 551g screwed on the front drive shaft 551 to restrain the front drive shaft 551 from axial movement. The rear drive shaft 552 has one end connected through a universal joint to the propeller shaft 537, and the other end integrally provided with a transfer driven gear 552a. The rear drive shaft 552 is supported for rotation in a plurality of ball bearings 552b on the third case 503 and the fourth case 504 of the transmission case 506. The double-pinion planetary gear 555 has the sun gear 556 coupled with the front drive shaft 551 by the splines 551b, a ring gear 557, a first pinion 558 engaged with the ring gear 557, a second pinion 559 engaged with the sun gear 556 and the first pinion 558, and a carrier 560 rotatably supporting the first pinion 558 and the second pinion 559 in needle bearings 560a thereon. Power applied to the ring gear 557 is distributed to the sun gear 556 and the carrier 560 at a torque distribution ratio dependent on the dimensions of the sun gear 556 and the ring gear 557. When the ring gear 557 is fastened to the transmission case 506, the sun gear 556 is rotated by the power applied to the carrier 560 in a direction opposite the rotating direction of the carrier 560. The sun gear 556 of the double-pinion planetary gear 555 is held between a thrust bearing 561a supported through a fixed shaft 562 fixed to the transmission case 506, a thrust bearing 562a and a drum 569 on the third case 503 of the transmission case 506, and a thrust bearing 561b supported through the fourth multiple-disk clutch 593, i.e., a fourth friction coupling element, a thrust bearing 582a and a transfer drive gear 582 on the fourth case 504 of the transmission case 506 to restrain the double-pinion planetary gear 555 from axial movement. The fixed shaft 562 is substantially cylindrical, extends around the front drive shaft 551, and has a base end provided with a flange fastened to the third case 503 of the transmission case 506 with bolts 562a. A space between the inner circumference of the fixed shaft 562 and the front drive shaft 551 is sealed with an oil seal 565 to form a pressure chamber 565A. The fixed shaft 562 is provided with an oil passage 562b connected to the pressure chamber 565A, and an oil passage 562c in its outer circumference. The primary driven gear 529 engaged with the primary reduction gear 528 is supported for rotation on the fixed shaft 562 by a needle bearing 529a. An input selecting means 567 for selectively transmitting power from the primary driven gear 529 selectively to the ring gear 557 or the carrier 560 is interposed between the primary driven gear 529 and the double-pinion planetary gear 555. The input selecting means 567 comprises a first multiple-disk clutch 568, i.e., a first friction coupling element, and a second multiple-disk clutch 578, i.e., a second friction coupling element. In the first multiple-disk clutch 568, a drum 569 supported for rotation through a bushing 568a on the fixed shaft 562 is connected to the primary driven gear 529, and a hub 570 is connected to the ring gear 557 of the double-pinion planetary gear 555. The first multiple-disk clutch 568 interlocks the primary driven gear 529 and the ring gear 557 for power transmission. A pressure is applied to a pressure chamber 571 to compress a retaining plate 573c contiguous with a snap ring 573d, driven plates 573b and drive plates 573a by a piston 572 to engage the first multiple-disk clutch 568 for power transmission. Indicated at 572a is a sealing member fitted on the piston 572 and capable of providing liquid-tight sealing between the piston 572 and the drum 569 and of sliding along the drum 569. A retainer 575a is disposed on one side of the piston 572 opposite the other side of the same on which the pressure chamber 571 is formed, and a pressure is exerted on the piston 572 by a return spring 576. In the second multiple-disk clutch 578, the drum 569 serves also as the drum of the first multiple-disk clutch 568, and the hub 579 is connected to the carrier 560 of the double-pinion planetary gear 555. The second multiple-disk clutch 578 interlocks the primary driven gear 529 and the carrier 560 for power transmission. A pressure is applied to a pressure chamber 572 to compress a retaining plate 581c contiguous with a snap ring 581d fixed to the piston 572, driven plates 581b and drive plates 581a by a piston 574 to engage the second multiple-disk clutch 578 for power transmission. Indicated at 574a is a sealing member fitted on the piston 574 and capable of providing liquid-tight sealing between the pistons 572 and 574 and between the piston 574 and the drum 569, and of sliding along the drum 569. A centrifugal pressure generated in a pressure chamber 580 is counterbalanced with a pressure in a balancing pressure chamber 575. A pressure is exerted on the piston 574 by the return spring 576. The transfer drive gear 582 is supported for rotation by a ball bearing 582a on the third case 503 of the transmission case 506 and by a needle bearing 582b on the front drive shaft 551 on one side of the double-pinion planetary gear 555 opposite the other side of the same on which the input selecting means 567 is disposed. A transfer driven gear 552a mounted on the rear drive shaft 552 is engaged with the transfer drive gear 582 for power transmission. A third multiple-disk clutch 584, i.e., a third friction coupling element for selectively transmitting power from the carrier 560 of the double-pinion planetary gear 555 to the transfer drive gear 582, is interposed between the double-pinion planetary gear 555 and the transfer drive gear 582. The third multiple-disk clutch 584 has a drum 585 coupled with the transfer drive gear 582 by splines, and a hub 586 connected to the carrier 560 of the double-pinion planetary gear 555. The third multiple-disk clutch 584 transmits power from the carrier 560 to the transfer drive gear 582. A pressure is applied to a pressure chamber 587 to compress a retaining plate 589c contiguous with a snap ring 589d fixed to the drum 585, driven plates 589b and drive plates 589a by a piston 588 to engage the third multiple-disk clutch 584 for power transmission. A retainer 590 is disposed on one side of the piston 588 opposite the other side of the same on which the pressure chamber 587 is formed to form a balancing pressure chamber 591 for counterbalancing a centrifugal pressure generated in the pressure chamber 587. A pressure is exerted on the piston 588 by a return spring 592. A fourth multiple-disk clutch 593, i.e., a fourth coupling element for selectively interlocking the front drive shaft 551 and the transfer drive gear 582 for power transmission, is interposed between the rear end of the front drive shaft 551 and the transfer drive gear 582. The fourth multiple-disk clutch 593 has a drum 594 coupled with the front drive shaft 551 by the splines 551c formed on the front drive shaft 551, and a hub 595 connected to the transfer drive gear 582 for power transmission. A pressure is applied to a pressure chamber 596 to compress a retaining plate 598c contiguous with a snap ring 598d fixed to the drum 594, driven plates 598b and drive plates 598a coupled with the hub 595 by a piston 597 to engage the fourth multiple-disk clutch 593 for power transmission. A retainer 599 is disposed so as to form a balancing pressure chamber 5100 for counterbalancing a centrifugal pressure generated in the pressure chamber 596. A pressure is exerted on the piston 597 by a return spring 5101. A fifth multiple-disk clutch 5102, i.e., a fifth friction coupling element for selectively fastening the ring gear 557 to the transmission case 506, is interposed between the third case 503 of the transmission case 506 and the ring gear 557 of the double-pinion planetary gear 555. A pressure is applied to a pressure chamber 5103 to compress a retaining plate 5105c contiguous with a snap ring 5105d fixed to the transmission caste 506, driven plates 5105b and drive plates 5105a coupled with the hub 570 connected to the ring gear 557 by a piston 5104 to engage the fifth multiple-disk clutch 5102 to fasten the ring gear 557 to the transmission case 506. A pressure is exerted on the piston 5104 by a return spring 5106. A control valve 5110 is disposed in the oil pan 5109 joined to a lower portion of the transmission case 506. The control valve 5110 is controlled by the hydraulic controller 547 on the basis of signals provided by the traveling speed sensor 541, the throttle opening sensor 542, the shift switch 543, the front wheel speed sensor 544, the rear wheel speed sensor 545 and the steering angle sensor 546 to supply the oil discharged from the oil pump 516 selectively to the input selecting means 567, the respective pressure chambers 571, 580, 587, 596 and 5103 of the third multiple-disk clutch 584, the fourth multiple-disk clutch 593 and the fifth multiple-disk clutch 5102, and the variable-speed transmission 520. The operation of the automobile driving system thus constructed will be described with reference to FIGS. 43 to 47, and FIG. 48 tabulating the operating conditions of the first multiple-disk clutch 568, the second multiple-disk clutch 578. third multiple-disk clutch 584, the fourth multiple-disk clutch 593 and the fifth multiple-disk clutch 5102. In the table shown in FIG. 48, blank circles indicate that the corresponding multiple-disk clutches are engaged or operative. The power of the engine 510 is transmitted from the crankshaft 511 through the torque converter 513 to the primary shaft 521 of the variable-speed transmission 520. An input speed of the primary shaft 521 is converted continuously into an output speed of the secondary shaft 522 by the action of the primary pulley 523 and the secondary pulley 524 operatively connected by the drive belt 525. The output speed of the secondary shaft 522 is reduced by the action of the primary reduction gear 528 and the primary driven gear 529, and a reduced speed is transmitted through the drum 569 to the first multiple-disk clutch 568 and the second multiple-disk clutch 578. The first multiple-disk clutch 568 and the second multiple-disk clutch 578 are disengaged and power is not transmitted beyond the first multiple-disk clutch 568 and the second multiple-disk clutch 578 when a neutral position N or a parking position P is selected. When a drive range D, i.e., a forward range, is selected, the first multiple-disk clutch 568 and the third multiple-disk clutch 584 are engaged to transmit driving power through a drive line indicated by thick lines in FIG. 43. A pressure is applied through the control valve 5110 to the pressure chamber 571 to compress the retaining plate 573c contiguous with the snap ring 573d fixed to the inner circumference of the drum 569, the driven plates 573b, and the drive plates 573a by the piston 572 so that the first multiple-disk clutch 568 is engaged. Consequently, power is transmitted from the primary driven gear 529 to the ring gear 557 of the double-pinion planetary gear 555. A pressure is applied also to the pressure chamber 587 to compress the retaining plate 589c, the driven plate 589b and the drive plate 589a of the third multiple-disk clutch 584 by the piston 588 to engage the third multiple-disk clutch 584. Consequently, the carrier 560 of the double-pinion planetary gear 555 and the transfer drive gear 582 are interlocked for power transmission. Accordingly, in the double-pinion planetary gear 555 in which the ring gear 557, i.e., input member, and the first pinion 558 are engaged, and the second pinion 559 is engaged with the first pinion 558 and the sun gear 556 as shown in FIG. 44, the sun gear 556 and the carrier 560 are rotated for differential rotation in the same direction as the rotating direction of the ring gear 557, and torque is distributed at a predetermined distribution ratio to the sun gear 556 and the carrier 560. Thus the front drive shaft 551 coupled with the sun gear 556 by the splines, and the transfer drive gear 582 interlocked with the carrier 560 are rotated in the same direction as that of rotation of the ring gear 557, whereby the rear drive shaft 552 is driven for rotation in a direction opposite the rotating direction of the ring gear 557 through the transfer drive gear 582 and the transfer driven gear 552a engaged with the transfer drive gear 582. During torque transmission, the double-pinion planetary gear 556 serves as a center differential gear in which the first pinion 558 and the second pinion 559 rotate and revolve round the sun gear 556 to absorb the difference in rotating speed between the sun gear 556 and the carrier 560. The second multiple-disk clutch 475 is disengaged to release the ring gear 457 of the double-pinion planetary gear 455 as shown in FIG. 35. Since the carrier 460 is coupled with the front drive shaft 451 by the splines, the double-pinion planetary gear 455 rotates together with the drive shaft 451. The torque distributing function of the double-pinion planetary gear 555 will be described with reference to a graph shown in FIG. 45. The relation between torque distribution and the numbers of teeth of the ring gear 557 and the sun gear 556 is expressed by: Ti=TF+TR TF:TR=ZS:(ZR-ZS) where Ti is input torque applied to the ring gear 557, TF is the torque of the sun gear 556 to be transmitted to the front wheels, TR is the torque of the carrier 560 to be transmitted to the rear wheels, ZS is the number of teeth of the sun gear 556 and ZR is the number of teeth of the ring gear 557. Accordingly, an optional reference torque distribution ratio TF/TR can be provided by properly determining ZS of the sun gear 556 and ZR of the ring gear 557. If ZS=37 and ZR=82, TF:TR=37:(82-37) Then, TF:TR.apprxeq.45:55 which signifies that about 45% and about 55% of the input torque applied to the double-pinion planetary gear 555 are distributed to the front wheels and the rear wheels, respectively. Thus, a rear-biased reference torque distribution mode, i.e., a torque distribution mode in which a major part of the input torque is distributed to the rear wheels, can be established. A pressure is applied to the pressure chamber 596 of the fourth multiple-disk clutch 593 to compress the snap ring 598d, the retaining plate 598c, the driven plate 598b and the drive plat 598a by the piston 597 to produce clutch torque Tc. The hydraulic controller 547 controls the control valve 5110 to vary the clutch torque Tc. Front wheel speed NF and rear wheel speed NR measured by the front wheel speed sensor 544 and the rear wheel speed sensor 545 are given to the hydraulic controller 547. The rear wheels always starts slipping first if the vehicle is traveling on a slippery road in the rear-biased reference torque distribution mode, i.e., in a mode in which TF<TR. Therefore, slip S is defined by S=NF/NR (S>0). A clutch pressure Pc corresponding to a slip S and a steering angle .PSI. given to the hydraulic controller 547 from the steering angle sensor 546 is retrieved from a map of FIG. 45 stored in the hydraulic controller 547. If the rear wheels are not slipping and S.gtoreq.1, the clutch pressure Pc is relatively low. If the rear wheels are slipping and S<1, the clutch pressure Pc is increased as the slip S decreases, and the clutch pressure Pc is set to Pmax when the slip S is not greater than a predetermined threshold slip S1. The line pressure is adjusted to the clutch pressure Pc for the variable control of the clutch torque Tc of the fourth multiple-disk clutch 593. Thus, a bypass drive line 5111 is formed by engaging the fourth multiple-disk clutch 593. The bypass drive line 5111 is capable of transferring part of a driving torque transmitted to the transfer drive gear 582 to the front drive shaft 551 and of transferring part of a driving torque transmitted to the front drive shaft 551 to the transfer drive gear 582. The bypass drive line 5111 exercises a differential function to meet (rear wheel speed NR)>(rotating speed of the ring gear 557)>(front wheel speed NF) in the transfer unit 550 if the rear wheels slip, and the torque transmitted through the fourth multiple-disk clutch 593 to the front drive shaft 551 is increased by the clutch torque Tc, and the torque transmitted through the transfer driven gear 552a engaged with the transfer drive gear 582 to the rear drive shaft 552 is reduced by the clutch torque Tc distributed to the front wheels. Consequently, TF=0.45Ti+Tc TR=0.55Ti-Tc Accordingly, the torque is distributed to the front wheels and the rear wheels at a rear-biased torque distribution ratio TF:TR.apprxeq.45:55 when neither the front wheels nor the rear wheels are slipping because the clutch torque Tc=0 if neither the front wheels nor the rear wheels are slipping. When the rear wheels are slipping and the clutch torque Tc is generated, more part of the input torque Ti is distributed to the front wheels through the bypass drive line 5111 shown in FIG. 44 if the clutch torque Tc is greater, and the torque distribution ratio TF:TR changes to TF1:TR1 as shown in FIG. 45 so that the torque distributed to the front wheels is increased and the torque distributed to the rear wheels is decreased. Consequently, the slip of the rear wheels is decreased and the traction of the vehicle is improved. When the slip S is decreased below the predetermined threshold slip, the pressure of the oil supplied to the fourth multiple-disk clutch 593 increases, differential limiting torque increases to a maximum, and the sun gear 556 and the carrier 560 are connected directly. Consequently, the differential motion of the transfer unit 550 is locked and a direct four-wheel-drive mode in which the torque is distributed at a torque distribution ratio corresponding to front-rear axle weight distribution ratio is established, whereby the traction of the vehicle is enhanced to a maximum. If the front wheels slip, the differential function of the transfer unit 550 meets a condition: (rear wheel speed NR)<(rotating speed of the ring gear 557)<(front wheel speed NF), a torque is transmitted from the front drive shaft 551 to the transfer drive gear 582 according to the clutch torque Tc, and the torque transmitted from the front drive shaft 551 to the front wheels is reduced by the clutch torque Tc distributed to the rear wheels. Consequently, TF=0.45Ti-Tc TR=0.55Ti+Tc Accordingly, the torque is distributed to the front wheels and the rear wheels at a rear-biased torque distribution ratio TF:TR.apprxeq.45:55 when neither the front wheels nor the rear wheels are slipping because the clutch torque Tc=0 if neither the front wheels nor the rear wheels are slipping. When the front wheels are slipping and the clutch torque Tc is generated, the input torque Ti is distributed to the rear wheels according to the clutch torque Tc to increase the torque distributed to the rear wheels positively and to reduce the torque distributed to the front wheels, so that the traction of the vehicle is improved. If the slip S is decreased below the predetermined threshold slip, the pressure of the oil supplied to the fourth multiple-disk clutch 593 increases, differential limiting torque increases to a maximum, and the sun gear 556 and the carrier 560 are connected directly. Consequently, the differential motion of the transfer unit 550 is locked and a direct four-wheel-drive mode in which the torque is distributed at a torque distribution ratio corresponding to front-rear axle weight distribution ratio is established, whereby the traction of the vehicle is fully enhanced. Thus, the torques distributed to the front and the rear wheels are controlled in a wide range according to the mode of slip to avoid the reduction of traction. If the vehicle turns during the torque distribution control for suppressing slip, the differential limiting torque of the third multiple-disk clutch 584 is reduced for correction according to the steering angle .PSI.. Consequently, the differential limiting effect of the transfer unit 550 is reduced and the difference in rotating speed can be satisfactorily absorbed, so that tight corner braking is avoided and satisfactory controllability can be secured. When a reverse range R is selected, the first multiple-disk clutch 568 and the third multiple-disk clutch 584 are disengaged and the second multiple-disk clutch 578, the fourth multiple-disk clutch 593 and the fifth multiple-disk clutch 5102 are engaged to transmit power through a drive line indicated by thick lines in FIG. 43. A pressure is applied through the control valve 5110 to the pressure chamber 580 to compress the snap ring 581d, the retaining plate 581c, the drive plates 581a and the driven plates 581b by the piston 574 to engage the second multiple-disk clutch 578 to transmit power from the primary driven gear 529 to the carrier 560 of the double-pinion planetary gear 555. A pressure is applied to the pressure chamber 5103 to compress the snap ring 5105d, the retaining plate 5105c, the drive plates 5105a and the driven plates 5105b by the piston 5104 to engage the fifth multiple-disk clutch 5102, whereby the ring gear 557 is fastened to the transmission case 506. The snap ring 593d, the retaining plate 598c, the drive plates 598a and the driven plates 598b are compressed by the piston 597 to engage the fourth multiple-disk clutch 593, so that power is transmitted from the front drive shaft 551 to the transfer drive shaft 582. Consequently, as shown in FIG. 47, the first pinion 558 and the second pinion 559 rotate in the opposite directions, respectively, and revolve along the ring gear 557 to rotate the sun gear 556 in a direction opposite the rotating direction of the carrier 560. Consequently, the front drive shaft 551 is driven for rotation in the reverse direction, power is transmitted from the front drive shaft 551 through the fourth multiple-disk clutch 593 to the transfer drive gear 582 to drive the rear drive shaft 552 for rotation in a direction opposite the rotating direction of the front drive shaft 551. Therefore, the power transmitted to the primary driven gear 529 is transmitted in a direction opposite a direction in which power is transmitted when the drive range D is selected to the front drive shaft 551 and the rear drive shaft 552. Thus, the double-pinion planetary gear 555 is capable of a forward/reverse selecting function. In this case, power is transmitted from the carrier 560 to the front drive shaft 551 and the rear drive shaft 552 at a gear ratio expressed by: Gear ratio=[ZS+(-ZR)]/ZS If ZS=37 and ZR=82, Gear ratio=[37+(-82)]/37=-1.216 which is an appropriate gear ratio for the reverse range R. The clutch torque Tc among the input torque Ti applied to the carrier 560 is transmitted to the transfer drive gear 582 and the rest of the input torque Ti is transmitted to the front wheels. Ti=TF+TR TF=Ti-Tc TR=Tc Therefore, the traction of the vehicle is improved by reducing the clutch torque Tc so that part of the input torque Ti distributed to the front wheels is increased to increase the torque of the front wheels positively and to reduce the torque of the rear wheels when the rear wheels slip in order that the slip is suppressed. If the slip S is decreased blow the predetermined threshold slip, the pressure of the oil supplied to the fourth multiple-disk clutch 593 is increased to a maximum and the differential limiting torque Tc is increased to a maximum to connect the front drive shaft 551 and the transfer drive gear 582 directly to establish a direct four-wheel-drive mode in which the torque is distributed at a torque distribution ratio corresponding to front-rear axle weight distribution ratio, whereby the traction of the vehicle is fully enhanced. Thus, the torques distributed to the front and the rear wheels are controlled in a wide range according to the mode of slip to avoid the reduction of traction. If the vehicle turns during the torque distribution control for suppressing slip, the differential limiting torque of the fourth multiple-disk clutch 593 is reduced for correction according to the steering angle .PSI.. Consequently, the difference in rotating speed can be satisfactorily absorbed, so that tight corner braking is avoided and satisfactory controllability can be secured. In the fifth embodiment, the front drive shaft 551 and the rear drive shaft 552 for transmitting power to the front differential gear 530 connected to the output side of the belt-drive variable-speed transmission 520 and the rear differential gear 538, respectively, are disposed in parallel to the crankshaft 511 of the transverse engine 510, the double-pinion planetary gear 555 is mounted on the front drive shaft 551 with its sun gear 556 coupled with the front drive shaft 551, the first multiple-disk clutch 568 is capable of transmitting the output of the variable-speed transmission 520 to the ring gear 557, the second multiple-disk clutch 578 is capable of transmitting the output of the variable-speed transmission 520 to the carrier 560, the third multiple-disk clutch 584 is capable of interlocking the carrier 560 and the transfer drive gear 582 for power transmission, the fourth multiple-disk clutch 593 is capable of interlocking the front drive shaft 551 and the rear drive shaft 552 for power transmission, the fifth multiple-disk clutch 5102 is capable of restraining the ring gear 557 from rotation, and the multiple-disk clutches 568, 568, 584, 593 and 5102 are controlled selectively so that the automobile driving system exercises the functions of a center differential gear to distribute torques properly to the front drive shaft 551 and the rear drive shaft 552 and to achieve a differential limiting operation so that the vehicle is able to travel satisfactorily when the drive range D, i.e., the forward range, or the reverse range R is selected and exercises the functions of a forward/reverse selecting mechanism when the drive range D or the reverse range R is selected. Whereas the conventional automobile driving system needs special double-pinion planetary gears respectively for a center differential gear and a forward/reverse selecting mechanism, the automobile driving system in the fifth embodiment according to the present invention needs a single double-pinion planetary gear for both the functions of the center differential gear and those of the forward/reverse selecting mechanism. Therefore, the automobile driving system in the fifth embodiment according to the present invention exercises high performance, has a simple, compact, lightweight construction having a small overall length, simplifies control operations, and can be manufactured at a low manufacturing cost. Accordingly, the automobile driving system can be installed on a vehicle body with only a small portion or no portion thereof projected into a tunnel formed under a passenger room to reduce greatly the sectional area of the portion of the tunnel protruding into the passenger room, a sufficiently large space can be secured between the toe board and the automobile driving system, and a sufficiently large space can be secured to form a passenger room which provides improved comfortability. Since an increased space is secured between the toe board and the automobile driving system, a sufficient crush stroke necessary for protecting the passenger in the case of collision can be secured, and a sufficiently large space is available for work for installing the transmission in and removing the same from the engine room. Furthermore, the degree of freedom of vehicle body design is increased and the automobile driving system can be mounted on a slant nose body having a low engine hood. An electromagnetic clutch or a wet clutch may be employed instead of the torque converter 513. If an electromagnetic clutch or a wet clutch is employed instead of the torque converter, the transmission of power to the primary shaft 531 of the belt-drive variable-speed transmission 520 and beyond the belt-drive variable-speed transmission 520 can be intercepted when the neutral position N or the parking position P is selected. It is known from the comparative examination of the automobile driving system 500 in the fifth embodiment for a four-wheel drive vehicle and the automobile driving system 100 in the first embodiment for a two-wheel drive vehicle that the torque converter, the belt-drive variable-speed transmission, the front differential gear, the first, the second and the fifth case forming the transmission case containing the belt-drive variable-speed transmission, and the principal components of the transfer unit including the front drive shaft, the double-pinion planetary gear, the fixed shaft, and the first and the second multiple-disk clutch are common to the automobile driving system 500 in the fifth embodiment for a four-wheel drive vehicle and the automobile driving system 100 in the first embodiment for a two-wheel drive vehicle. Therefore, the principal portions of the automobile driving system for a four-wheel drive vehicle can be constructed relatively easily by additionally incorporating the power transmitting mechanism for transmitting power to the rear differential gear including the third, the fourth and the fifth clutch, the transfer drive gear and the rear drive shaft into the automobile driving system 100 in the first embodiment for a two-wheel drive vehicle. Sixth Embodiment A driving system 600 in a sixth embodiment according to the present invention for a four-wheel drive vehicle will be described hereinafter with reference to FIGS. 49 to 56. Referring to FIG. 49, in the automobile driving system 600 in the sixth embodiment for a four-wheel drive vehicle, a torque converter case 601 joined to a longitudinal engine 610 to contain a torque converter 620, a variable-speed transmission housing 602 disposed behind the torque converter case 601 and containing a belt-drive variable-speed transmission 630 and a front differential gear 640, a case 604 disposed behind the variable-speed transmission housing 602 and containing a transfer unit 650 on a bearing plate 603, and an extension case 605 disposed behind the case 604 and containing a power transmitting mechanism for transmitting the output of the transfer unit 650 to rear wheels are arranged and joined successively in that order to construct a transmission case 606. An oil pan is attached to a lower portion of the transmission case 606. The longitudinal engine 610 has a crankshaft 611 connected to the torque converter 620 contained in the torque converter case 601. An output shaft 621 associated with the torque converter 620 is coupled with a primary shaft 631 included in the belt-drive variable-speed transmission 630 contained in the variable-speed transmission case 602 to transmit power from the crankshaft 611 through the torque converter 620 to the primary shaft 631 of the variable-speed transmission 630. The variable-speed transmission 630 converts an input rotating speed to an output rotating speed of a secondary shaft 632. Power is transmitted from the secondary shaft 632 to the transfer unit 650 contained in the case 604 and the extension case 605. The transfer unit 650 transfers power through the front differential gear 640 to front wheels and through a propeller shaft 647 and a rear differential gear 648 to rear wheels. An oil pump 608 which is driven continuously by an oil pump drive shaft 624a included in the torque converter 620 is contained in the torque converter case 601. The oil pump 608 discharges oil at a line pressure continuously to supply the oil to the torque converter 620 and associated parts, enables the hydraulic control of the variable-speed transmission 630, and enables the hydraulic control of the transfer unit 650 by a hydraulic controller 609 on the basis of signals provided by a traveling speed sensor 609a, a throttle opening sensor 609b, a shift switch 609c, a front wheel speed sensor 609d, a rear wheel speed sensor 609e and a steering angle sensor 609f. The torque converter 620, the belt-type variable-speed transmission 630, the front differential gear 640 and the transfer unit 650 will be successively described with reference to FIGS. 50 and 51. As shown in FIG. 50 in a sectional view, the torque converter 620 has the output shaft 621 supported for rotation in ball bearings 631a on the variable-speed transmission housing 602 and the bearing plate 603 coaxially with the crankshaft 611. The output shaft 621 is surrounded so as to be rotatable by a stator shaft 622 having a substantially cylindrical outer circumference, and provided at its base end with a flange bolted to the variable-speed transmission case 602. The oil pump drive shaft 624a joined to an impeller 624 is fitted rotatably on the stator shaft 622. The outer circumference of the impeller 624 is joined to the outer circumference of a front cover 625 and connected by a starter ring gear 625a attached to the outer circumference of the front cover 625, and a drive plate 626 bolted to the crankshaft 611 so as to rotate together with the crankshaft 611. A turbine 627 is disposed opposite to the impeller 624 and is coupled with the output shaft 621 by splines. A stator 628 is interposed between the impeller 624 and the turbine 627 and is supported on a one-way clutch 628a mounted on the stator shaft 622. A lock-up clutch 629 is interposed between the turbine 627 and the front cover 625. The oil pump 608 comprising an inner gear 608a driven for rotation by the oil pump drive shaft 624a, an outer gear 608b engaged with the inner gear 608a, and an oil pump housing 608c is mounted on the base end of the stator shaft 622. The rotation of the crankshaft 611 of the engine 610 is transmitted through the drive plate 626 bolted to the crankshaft 611, the starter ring gear 625a and the front cover 625 to the impeller 624 to drive the same for rotation. As the impeller 624 rotates, the oil is discharged outside from the impeller 624 by centrifugal force, the oil flows into the turbine 627 to transmit a torque acting in the same direction as the rotating direction of the impeller 624 to the turbine 627, so that the output shaft 621 coupled by the splines with the turbine 627 is driven for rotation. The direction of flow of the oil flowing out from the turbine 627 is deflected by the stator 628 in a direction to assist the rotation of the impeller 624 to increase the torque of the impeller 624. If the turbine 627 rotates at a high rotating speed, the oil flows against the back surface of the stator 628 to make the stator 628 rotate freely on the one-way clutch 628a. When a fixed traveling speed or rotating speed is achieved, the lock-up clutch 629 engages the impeller 624 and the turbine 627 through the front cover 625 to make the torque converter operate without slipping; consequently, the operating speed of the engine 610 is reduced accordingly, whereby fuel consumption is reduced and silence is improved. The belt-drive variable-speed transmission 630 has a primary shaft 631, a secondary shaft 632 disposed in parallel to the primary shaft 631, a primary pulley 633 mounted on the primary shaft 631, a secondary pulley 634 mounted on the secondary shaft 632, and a drive belt 635 extended between the primary pulley 633 and the secondary pulley 634. The respective widths of the grooves of the primary pulley 633 and the secondary pulley 634 are varied to vary the ratio between the pitch diameters of the primary pulley 633 and the secondary pulley 634 for continuously variable speed change. The primary pulley 633 mounted on the primary shaft 631 formed integrally with the output shaft 621 has a fixed cone 633a formed integrally with the primary shaft 631 and a movable cone 633b axially movable relative to the fixed cone 633a. The fixed cone 633a and the movable cone 633b must hold the drive belt 635 by a predetermined clamping force and the width of the groove defined by the fixed cone 633a and the movable cone 633b must be smoothly controllable to ensure the smooth operation of the transmission for continuously variable speed change. Therefore, a plurality of axial grooves are formed in the mating surfaces of the primary shaft 631 and the movable cone 633b, and balls 633c are placed in the mating grooves for torque transmission. A substantially cylindrical first piston 637a is fixed to the back surface of the movable cone 633b, i.e., a surface not facing the fixed cone 633a, a pressure chamber 637A is formed by the first piston 637a and a cylinder 637b having the shape of a bottomed cylinder and having a central portion fixed to the primary shaft 631. The opposite ends of a second piston 637d are fitted in a piston 637c fixed to the back surface of the movable cone 633b, and the first piston 637a, respectively, to form a pressure chamber 637B. The movable cone 633b is biased by a hydraulic actuator 637 including a spring 637e toward the fixed cone 633a. An oil passage 631b is formed in the primary shaft 631 so as to be connected to the pressure chambers 637A and 637B. The hydraulic controller 609 executes a control operation on the basis of signals representing the opening of the throttle and such to supply the oil into and to discharge the same from the pressure chambers 637A and 637B of the hydraulic actuator 637 through an oil passage 603b formed in the bearing plate 603 and a sleeve 603c to move the movable cone 633b along the primary shaft 631 to vary the width of the groove of the pulley. The secondary shaft 632 extended in parallel to the primary shaft 631 is supported for rotation in ball bearings 632a on the variable-speed transmission housing 602 and the bearing plate 603. The secondary pulley 634 mounted on the secondary shaft 632 has a fixed cone 634a formed integrally with the secondary shaft 632, and a movable cone 634b axially movable relative to the fixed cone 634a. A plurality of axial grooves are formed in the mating surfaces of the movable cone 634b and the secondary shaft 632, and balls 634c are placed in the mating axial grooves for torque transmission from the secondary pulley 634 to the secondary shaft 632. A substantially cylindrical cylinder 636a is fixed to the back surface of the movable cone 634b, a pressure chamber 636A is defined by the cylinder 636a and a cylindrical piston 636b having a central portion fixed to the secondary shaft 632, and the movable cone 634b is biased toward the fixed cone 634a by a spring 636c to constitute a hydraulic actuator 636. An oil passage 632b is formed in the secondary shaft 632 so as to be connected to the pressure chamber 636A. The hydraulic controller 609 executes a control operation on the basis of signals representing the opening of the throttle and such to supply the oil into and to discharge the same from the pressure chamber 636A of the hydraulic actuator 636 through an oil passage 604a formed in the case 604. A drive gear 639 is mounted on one end of the secondary shaft 632. The pressure receiving area of the movable cone 633b of the primary pulley 633 is greater than that of the movable cone 634b of the secondary pulley 634. Therefore, when the oil is supplied into and discharged from the pressure chambers 637A, 637B and 636A, the mode of variation of the width of the groove of the primary pulley 633 and that of the width of the groove of the secondary pulley 634 are reverse to each other. Thus, the ratio between the pitch diameters of the primary pulley 633 and the secondary pulley 634 is varied continuously to vary the output rotating speed of the secondary shaft 632 continuously. The front differential gear 640 is entirely the same in construction as the front differential gear 130 employed in the first embodiment. Therefore, a crown gear 643 included in the front differential gear 640 may be of a small diameter, the front differential gear 640 can be formed in a relatively small overall size, and the variable-speed transmission 630 and the front differential gear 640 can be disposed close to each other. The construction of the transfer unit 650 will be described hereinafter with reference to FIGS. 50 and 51. The transfer unit 650 has a front drive shaft 651, i.e., a first drive shaft, and a rear drive shaft 652, i.e., a second drive shaft, parallel to the crankshaft 611 of the engine 610, the output shaft 621, the primary shaft 631 and the secondary shaft 632. The arrangement, as viewed in the direction of the arrow A in FIG. 50, of the crankshaft 611, the primary shaft 631, the secondary shaft 632 and the front drive shaft 651 and the rear drive shaft 652 extended in parallel to each other is entirely the same as that of the corresponding shafts of the fifth embodiment previously described with reference to FIG. 42. Thus, the driving system is formed in a compact construction having a relatively small height to facilitate the combination of the same with the variable-speed transmission 630. Since the rear drive shaft 652 and the primary shaft 631 are included in the same vertical plane one above the other, the automobile driving system can be easily inserted in a tunnel 649 and the compatibility of the automobile driving system with both a vehicle body designed to be mounted with a manual transmission (MT) and a vehicle body designed to be mounted with an automatic transmission (AT). A pinion 651a to be engaged with the crown gear 643 of the front differential gear 640 is formed at one end of the front drive shaft 651. The front drive shaft 651 has one end rotatably supported in a taper roller bearing 651d on the bearing plate 603 of the transmission case 606, and the other end rotatably supported in a needle bearing 651e on the extension case 605. The front drive shaft 651 is provided in its rear end portion with splines 651b which engages with a disk 683 supporting a clutch drum 685 included in a third multiple-disk clutch 684, i.e., a third friction coupling element, and an oil passage 651c having one end opening in the rear end of the front drive shaft 651 and the other end opening into a pressure chamber 696 included in a fourth multiple-disk clutch, i.e., a fourth friction coupling element. The inner ring of the taper roller bearing 651d is held between the pinion 651a and a lock nut 651f screwed on the front drive shaft 651 to restrain the front drive shaft 651 from axial movement. The rear drive shaft 652 has one end connected through a universal joint to a propeller shaft 647, and the other end provided with a transfer driven gear 652a. The rear drive shaft 652 is supported for rotation in a plurality of ball bearings 652b on the case 604 and the extension case 605 of the transmission case 606. A hub 653 is rotatably mounted on the front drive shaft 651. The hub 653 has a cylindrical portion 653a fitted on the front drive shaft 651, and a flange 653b formed at the base end of the cylindrical portion 653a. The cylindrical portion 653a is provided with splines 653c which engage with the sun gear 656 of a double-pinion planetary gear 655 in a portion of its outer circumference near the flange 653b and splines 653d which engage with the clutch hub 695 of the fourth multiple-disk clutch 693, i.e., the fourth friction coupling element, in its rear end portion. A clutch hub 679 of the second multiple-disk clutch 678, i.e., a second friction coupling element, is formed integrally with the flange 653b. The hub 653 is held between a thrust bearing 653g supported on the bearing plate 603 by the fixed shaft 661 fixed to the bearing plate 603, and a thrust bearing 653h supported through a disk 683 supporting the clutch hubs 686 and 695 of the third multiple-disk clutch 684 and the fourth multiple-disk clutch 693 on the extension case 605 to restrain the hub 653 from axial movement. The double-pinion planetary gear 655 has the sun gear 656 coupled with the hub 653 by the splines 653c formed in the outer circumference of the hub 653, a ring gear 657, a first pinion 658 engaged with the ring gear 657, a second pinion 659 engaged with the sun gear 656 and the first pinion 658, and a carrier 660 rotatably supporting the first pinion 658 and the second pinion 659 in needle bearings 660a thereon. Power applied to the ring gear 657 is distributed to the sun gear 656 and the carrier 660 at a torque distribution ratio dependent on the dimensions of the sun gear 656 and the ring gear 657. When the ring gear 657 is fastened to the case 604, the carrier 660 is rotated in a direction opposite the rotating direction of the sun gear 656. The fixed shaft 661 is substantially cylindrical, extends around the front drive shaft 651, and has a base end provided with a flange fastened to the bearing plate 603 of the transmission case 606 with bolts 661a. A space between the inner circumference of the fixed shaft 661 and the front drive shaft 651 is sealed with an oil seal 665 to form a pressure chamber 665A. The fixed shaft 661 is provided with an oil passage 661b connected to the pressure chamber 665A, and an oil passage 661c in its outer circumference. The driven gear 662 engaged with the drive gear 639 is supported for rotation on the fixed shaft 661 by a needle bearing 662a. An input selecting means 667 for selectively transmitting power from the driven gear 662 selectively to the ring gear 657 or through the hub 653 to the sun gear 656 is interposed between the driven gear 662 and the double-pinion planetary gear 655. The input selecting means 667 comprises the first multiple-disk clutch 668, i.e., a first friction coupling element, and the second multiple-disk clutch 678, i.e., a second friction coupling element. In the first multiple-disk clutch 668, a clutch drum 669 supported for rotation through a bushing 669a on the fixed shaft 661 is connected to the driven gear 662, a clutch hub 670 is connected to the ring gear 657 of the double-pinion planetary gear 655. The first multiple-disk clutch 668 interlocks the driven gear 662 and the ring gear 657 for power transmission. A pressure is applied to a pressure chamber 671 to compress a retaining plate 673c contiguous with a snap ring 673d, driven plates 673b and drive plates 673a by a piston 672 to engage the first multiple-disk clutch 668 for power transmission. Indicated at 672a is a sealing member fitted on the piston 672 and capable of providing liquid-tight sealing between the piston 672 and the clutch drum 669 and of sliding along the clutch drum 669. A retainer 675a is disposed on one side of the piston 672 opposite the other side of the same on which the pressure chamber 671 is formed, and a pressure is exerted on the piston 672 through the piston 674 by a return spring 676. In the second multiple-disk clutch 678, the clutch drum 669 serves also as the clutch drum of the first multiple-disk clutch 668, and the clutch hub 679 is formed integrally with the hub 653. The second multiple-disk clutch 678 is able to transmit power from the driven gear 662 through the hub 653 to the sun gear 656. A pressure is applied to a pressure chamber 680 to compress a retaining plate 681c contiguous with a snap ring 681d fixed to the piston 672, driven plates 681b and drive plates 681a by a piston 674 to engage the second multiple-disk clutch 678 for power transmission. A centrifugal pressure generated in the pressure chamber 680 is counterbalanced with a pressure in a balancing pressure chamber 675. A pressure is exerted on the piston 674 by the return spring 676. A transfer drive gear 682 is supported for rotation by a ball bearing 682a on the case 604 of the transmission case 606 and supported for rotation by a needle bearing 682b on the hub 653 on one side of the double-pinion planetary gear 655 opposite the other side of the same on which the input selecting means 667 is disposed. A transfer driven gear 652a mounted on the rear drive shaft 652 is engaged with the transfer drive gear 682 for power transmission. The carrier 660 of the double-pinion planetary gear 655 is coupled with the transfer drive gear 682 by splines, and a parking gear 682c is combined with the transfer drive gear 682. In the third multiple-disk clutch 684, the clutch drum 685 is connected to the transfer drive gear 682 by a drum member 685a and is supported for rotation coaxially with the front drive shaft 651 on the extension case 605, and the clutch hub 686 is connected to a disk 683 coupled with the front drive shaft 651 by the splines 651b. Thus, the third multiple-disk clutch 684 is interposed for power transmission between the transfer drive gear 682 and the front drive shaft 651. A pressure is applied to a pressure chamber 687 to compress a retaining plate 689c contiguous with a snap ring 689d fixed to the clutch drum 685, driven plates 689b and drive plates 689a by a piston 688 to engage the third multiple-disk clutch 684 for power transmission. A retainer 690 is disposed on one side of the piston 688 opposite the other side of the same on which the pressure chamber 687 is formed to form a balancing pressure chamber 691 for counterbalancing a centrifugal pressure generated in the pressure chamber 687. A pressure is exerted on the piston 688 by a return spring 692. The fourth multiple-disk clutch 693, i.e., a fourth coupling element, for selectively interlocking the front drive shaft and the hub 653 for power transmission is interposed between the front drive shaft 651 and the rear end of the hub 653. In the fourth multiple-disk clutch 693, a clutch drum 694 is coupled with the hub 653 by the splines 653d, the clutch hub 695 is connected to a disk 683, and the disk 683 is coupled with the front drive shaft 651 by splines for power transmission. A pressure is applied to a pressure chamber 696 to compress a retaining plate 698c contiguous with a snap ring 698d fixed to the clutch drum 694, driven plates 698b and drive plates 698a coupled with the clutch hub 695 by a piston 697 to engage the fourth multiple-disk clutch 693 for power transmission. A retainer 699 is disposed so as to form a balancing pressure chamber 6100 for counterbalancing a centrifugal pressure generated in the pressure chamber 696. A pressure is exerted on the piston 697 by a return spring 6101. A fifth multiple-disk clutch 6102, i.e., a fifth friction coupling element for selectively fastening the ring gear 657 to the case 604, is interposed between the case 604 of the transmission case 606 and the ring gear 657 of the double-pinion planetary gear 655. A pressure is applied to a pressure chamber 6103 formed in the fifth multiple-disk clutch 6102 to compress a retaining plate 6105c contiguous with a snap ring 6105d fixed to the case 604, driven plates 6105b and drive plates 6105a coupled with the clutch hub 670 connected to the ring gear 657 by a piston 6104 to engage the fifth multiple-disk clutch 6102 to fasten the ring gear 657 to the case 604. A pressure is exerted on the piston 6104 by a return spring 6106. A control valve 6110 is disposed in an oil pan 607 joined to a lower portion of the transmission case 606. The control valve 6110 is controlled by the hydraulic controller 609 on the basis of signals provided by the traveling speed sensor 609a, the throttle opening sensor 609b, the shift switch 609c, the front wheel speed sensor 609d, the rear wheel speed sensor 609e and the steering angle sensor 609f to supply the oil discharged from the oil pump 608 selectively to the input selecting means 667, the respective pressure chambers 671, 680, 687, 696 and 6103 of the third multiple-disk clutch 684, the fourth multiple-disk clutch 693 and the fifth multiple-disk clutch 6102, and the variable-speed transmission 630. The operation of the automobile driving system for a four-wheel drive vehicle thus constructed will be described with reference to FIGS. 52 to 55, and FIG. 56 tabulating the operating conditions of the first multiple-disk clutch 668, the second multiple-disk clutch 678. third multiple-disk clutch 684, the fourth multiple-disk clutch 693 and the fifth multiple-disk clutch 6102. In the table shown in FIG. 48, blank circles indicate that the corresponding multiple-disk clutches are engaged or operative, and parenthesized blank circles indicate that multiple-disk clutches are engaged or operative if necessary. The power of the engine 610 is transmitted from the crankshaft 611 through the torque converter 620 to the primary shaft 631 of the variable-speed transmission 630. An input speed of the primary shaft 631 is converted continuously into an output speed of the secondary shaft 632 by the action of the primary pulley 633 and the secondary pulley 634 operatively connected by the drive belt 635. The output speed of the secondary shaft 632 is reduced by the action of the drive gear 639 and the driven gear 662. and a reduced speed is transmitted through the clutch drum 669 to the first multiple-disk clutch 668 and the second multiple-disk clutch 678. The first multiple-disk clutch 668 and the second multiple-disk clutch 678 are disengaged and power is not transmitted beyond the first multiple-disk clutch 668 and the second multiple-disk clutch 678 when a neutral position N or a parking position P is selected. When a drive range D, i.e., a forward range, is selected, the first multiple-disk clutch 668 and the fourth multiple-disk clutch 693 are engaged to transmit driving power through a drive line indicated by thick lines in FIG. 52. A pressure is applied through the control valve 6110 to the pressure chamber 671 to compress the retaining plate 673c contiguous with the snap ring 673d fixed to the inner circumference of the clutch drum 669, the driven plates 673b, and the drive plates 673a by the piston 672 so that the first multiple-disk clutch 668 is engaged. Consequently, power is transmitted from the driven gear 662 to the ring gear 657 of the double-pinion planetary gear 655. A pressure is applied also to the pressure chamber 696 to compress the retaining plate 698c, the driven plate 698b and the drive plate 698a of the fourth multiple-disk clutch 693 by the piston 697 to engage the fourth multiple-disk clutch 693. Consequently, the sun gear 656 of the double-pinion planetary gear 655 and the front drive shaft 651 are interlocked for power transmission through the hub 653 and the third multiple-disk clutch 684. Accordingly, in the double-pinion planetary gear 655 in which the ring gear 657, i.e., input member, and the first pinion 658 are engaged, and the second pinion 659 is engaged with the first pinion 658 and the sun gear 656 as shown in FIG. 53, the sun gear 656 and the carrier 660 are rotated for differential rotation in the same direction as the rotating direction of the ring gear 657, and torque is distributed at a predetermined distribution ratio to the sun gear 656 and the carrier 660. Thus the front drive shaft 651 coupled with the disk 683 by splines is rotated through the hub 653 coupled with the sun gear 656 by splines, the fourth multiple-disk clutch 693 and the disk 683 in the rotating direction of the ring gear 657, the transfer drive gear 682 coupled with the carrier 660 by splines is rotated in the rotating direction of the ring gear 657, and the rear drive shaft 652 is driven in a direction opposite the rotating direction of the ring gear 657 by the transfer driven gear 652a engaged with the transfer drive gear 682. During torque transmission, the double-pinion planetary gear 655 serves as a center differential gear in which the first pinion 658 and the second pinion 659 rotate and revolve round the sun gear 656 to absorb the difference in rotating speed between the sun gear 656 and the carrier 660. The torque distributing function of the double-pinion planetary gear 655 will be described with reference to a graph shown in FIG. 53. The relation between torque distribution and the numbers of teeth of the ring gear 657 and the sun gear 656 is expressed by: where Ti is input torque applied to the ring gear 657, TF is the torque of the sun gear 656 to be transmitted to the front wheels, TR is the torque of the carrier 660 to be transmitted to the rear wheels, ZS is the number of teeth of the sun gear 656 and ZR is the number of teeth of the ring gear 657. Accordingly, an optional reference torque distribution ratio TF/TR can be provided by properly determining ZS of the sun gear 656 and ZR of the ring gear 657. which signifies that about 45% and about 55% of the input torque applied to the ring gear 657 of the double-pinion planetary gear 655 are distributed to the front wheels and the rear wheels, respectively. Thus, a rear-biased reference torque distribution mode, i.e., a torque distribution mode in which a major part of the input torque is distributed to the rear wheels, can be established. A pressure is applied to the pressure chamber 687 of the third multiple-disk clutch 684 to compress the snap ring 689d, the retaining plate 689c, the driven plate 689b and the drive plat 689a by the piston 688 to produce clutch torque Tc. The hydraulic controller 609 controls the control valve 6110 to vary the clutch torque Tc. Front wheel speed NF and rear wheel speed NR measured by the front wheel speed sensor 609d and the rear wheel speed sensor 609e are given to the hydraulic controller 609. The rear wheels always starts slipping first if the vehicle is traveling on a slippery road in the rear-biased reference torque distribution mode, i.e., in a mode in which TF<TR. Therefore, slip S is defined by S=NF/NR (S>0). A clutch pressure Pc corresponding to a slip S and a steering angle .PSI. given to the hydraulic controller 609 from the steering angle sensor 609f is retrieved from a map of FIG. 45 stored in the hydraulic controller 609. If the rear wheels are not slipping and S.gtoreq.1, the clutch pressure Pc is relatively low. If the rear wheels are slipping and S<1, the clutch pressure Pc is increased as the slip S decreases, and the clutch pressure Pc is set to Pmax when the slip S is not greater than a predetermined threshold slip S1. The line pressure is adjusted to the clutch pressure Pc for the variable control of the clutch torque Tc of the third multiple-disk clutch 684. Thus, a bypass drive line 6111 is formed by engaging the third multiple-disk clutch 684. The bypass drive line 6111 extends from the front drive shaft 651, through the third multiple-disk clutch 684, the transfer drive gear 682, the carrier 660, the sun gear 656, the hub 653 and the fourth multiple-disk clutch 693 to the front drive shaft 651. The bypass drive line 6111 exercises a differential function to meet (rear wheel speed NR)>(rotating speed of the ring gear 657)>(front wheel speed NF) in the transfer unit 650 if the rear wheels slip, and the torque transmitted through the third multiple-disk clutch 684 to the front drive shaft 651 is increased by the clutch torque Tc, and the torque transmitted through the transfer driven gear 652a engaged with the transfer drive gear 682 to the rear drive shaft 652 is reduced by the clutch torque Tc distributed to the front wheels. Consequently, Accordingly, the torque is distributed to the front wheels and the rear wheels at a rear-biased torque distribution ratio TF:TR (45:55 when neither the front wheels nor the rear wheels are slipping because the clutch torque Tc=0 if neither the front wheels nor the rear wheels are slipping. When the rear wheels are slipping and the clutch torque Tc is generated, more part of the input torque Ti is distributed to the front wheels through the bypass drive line 6111 if the clutch torque Tc is greater, and the torque distribution ratio TF:TR changes to TF1:TR1 as shown in FIG. 45 so that the torque distributed to the front wheels is increased and the torque distributed to the rear wheels is decreased. Consequently, the slip of the rear wheels is decreased and the traction of the vehicle is improved. When the slip S is decreased below the predetermined threshold slip, the pressure of the oil supplied to the third multiple-disk clutch 684 increases, differential limiting torque increases to a maximum, and the sun gear 656 and the carrier 660 are connected directly. Consequently, the differential motion of the transfer unit 650 is locked and a direct four-wheel-drive mode in which the torque is distributed at a torque distribution ratio corresponding to front-rear axle weight distribution ratio is established, whereby the traction of the vehicle is enhanced to a maximum. If the front wheels slip, the differential function of the transfer unit 650 meets a condition: (rear wheel speed NR)<(rotating speed of the ring gear 657)<(front wheel speed NF), a torque is transmitted from the front drive shaft 651 to the transfer drive gear 682 according to the clutch torque Tc, and the torque transmitted from the front drive shaft 651 to the front wheels is reduced by the clutch torque Tc distributed to the rear wheels. Consequently, Accordingly, the torque is distributed to the front wheels and the rear wheels at a rear-biased torque distribution ratio TF:TR.apprxeq.45:55 when neither the front wheels nor the rear wheels are slipping because the clutch torque Tc=0 if neither the front wheels nor the rear wheels are slipping. When the front wheels are slipping and the clutch torque Tc is generated, the input torque Ti is distributed to the rear wheels according to the clutch torque Tc to increase the torque distributed to the rear wheels positively and to reduce the torque distributed to the front wheels, so that the traction of the vehicle is improved. If the slip S is decreased below the predetermined threshold slip, the pressure of the oil supplied to the third multiple-disk clutch 684 increases, differential limiting torque increases to a maximum, and the sun gear 656 and the carrier 660 are connected directly. Consequently, the differential motion of the transfer unit 650 is locked and a direct four-wheel-drive mode in which the torque is distributed at a torque distribution ratio corresponding to front-rear axle weight distribution ratio is established, whereby the traction of the vehicle is fully enhanced. Thus, the torques distributed to the front and the rear wheels are controlled in a wide range according to the mode of slip to avoid the reduction of traction. If the vehicle turns during the torque distribution control for suppressing slip, the differential limiting torque of the third multiple-disk clutch 684 is reduced for correction according to the steering angle .PSI.. Consequently, the differential limiting effect of the transfer unit 650 is reduced and the difference in rotating speed can be satisfactorily absorbed, so that tight corner braking is avoided and satisfactory controllability can be secured. When a reverse range R is selected, the first multiple-disk clutch 668 and the fourth multiple-disk clutch 693 are disengaged and the second multiple-disk clutch 678, the third multiple-disk clutch 684 and the fifth multiple-disk clutch 6102 are engaged to transmit power through a drive line indicated by thick lines in FIG. 54. A pressure is applied through the control valve 6110 to the pressure chamber 680 to compress the snap ring 681d, the retaining plate 681c, the drive plates 681a and the driven plates 681b by the piston 674 to engage the second multiple-disk clutch 678 to transmit power from the driven gear 662 through the hub 653 to the sun gear 656 of the double-pinion planetary gear 655. A pressure is applied to the pressure chamber 6103 to compress the snap ring 6105d, the retaining plate 6105c, the drive plates 6105a and the driven plates 6105b by the piston 6104 to engage the fifth multiple-disk clutch 6102, whereby the ring gear 657 is fastened to the case 604. The snap ring 689d, the retaining plate 689c, the drive plates 689a and the driven plates 689b are compressed by the piston 688 to engage the third multiple-disk clutch 684, so that power is transmitted from the transfer drive gear 682 to the front drive shaft 651. Consequently, as shown in FIG. 55, the first pinion 558 and the second pinion 559 are rotated in the opposite directions, respectively, by the sun gear and revolve along the ring gear 657 to rotate the carrier 660 in a direction opposite the rotating direction of the sun gear 656. Consequently, the transfer drive gear 682 is driven for rotation in the reverse direction, power is transmitted from the transfer drive gear 683 through the third multiple-disk clutch 684 to the front drive shaft 651 to drive the rear drive shaft 652 for rotation in a direction opposite the rotating direction of the front drive shaft 651. Therefore, the power transmitted to the driven gear 662 is transmitted in a direction opposite a direction in which power is transmitted when the drive range D is selected to the front drive shaft 651 and the rear drive shaft 652 when the ring gear 657 of the double-pinion planetary gear 655 is fastened to the case 604 by the fifth multiple-disk clutch 6102. Thus, the double-pinion planetary gear 655 is capable of a forward/reverse selecting function. In this case, power is transmitted from the sun gear 656 to the front drive shaft 651 and the rear drive shaft 652 at a gear ratio expressed by: which is an appropriate gear ratio for the reverse range R. The clutch torque Tc among the input torque Ti applied to the sun gear 656 is transmitted to the front drive shaft 651 and the rest of the input torque Ti is transmitted to the rear wheels. Therefore, the traction of the vehicle is improved by increasing the clutch torque Tc so that part of the input torque Ti distributed to the front wheels is increased to increase the torque of the front wheels positively and to reduce the torque of the rear wheels when the rear wheels slip in order that the slip is suppressed. When the front wheels slip, the clutch torque Tc is reduced to distribute more part of the torque Ti to the rear wheels to increase the torque of the rear wheels positively and the torque of the front wheels is reduced to suppress slip and to improve traction. If the slip S is decreased blow the predetermined threshold slip, the pressure of the oil supplied to the third multiple-disk clutch 684 is increased to a maximum and the differential limiting torque Tc is increased to a maximum to connect the front drive shaft 651 and the transfer drive gear 682 directly to establish a direct four-wheel-drive mode in which the torque is distributed at a torque distribution ratio corresponding to front-rear axle weight distribution ratio, whereby the traction of the vehicle is fully enhanced. If the vehicle turns during the torque distribution control for suppressing slip, the differential limiting torque of the third multiple-disk clutch 684 is reduced according to the steering angle .PSI.. Consequently, the difference in rotating speed can be satisfactorily absorbed, so that tight corner braking is avoided and satisfactory controllability can be secured. In the sixth embodiment, the front drive shaft 651 and the rear drive shaft 652 for transmitting power to the front differential gear 640 connected to the output side of the belt-drive variable-speed transmission 630 and the rear differential gear 648, respectively, are disposed in parallel to the crankshaft 611 of the transverse engine 610, the double-pinion planetary gear 655 is mounted on the front drive shaft 551 with its sun gear 656 coupled with the front drive shaft 651 through the hub 653 and the fourth multiple-disk clutch 693, the first multiple-disk clutch 668 is capable of transmitting the output of the variable-speed transmission 630 to the ring gear 657, the second multiple-disk clutch 678 is capable of transmitting the output of the variable-speed transmission 630 to the hub 653, the third multiple-disk clutch 684 is capable of interlocking the front drive shaft 651 and the transfer drive gear 682 for power transmission, the fifth multiple-disk clutch 6102 is capable of restraining the ring gear 657 from rotation, and the multiple-disk clutches 668, 678, 684, 693 and 6102 are controlled selectively so that the automobile driving system exercises the functions of a center differential gear to distribute torques properly to the front drive shaft 651 and the rear drive shaft 652 and to achieve a differential limiting operation so that the vehicle is able to travel satisfactorily when the drive range D, i.e., the forward range, or the reverse range R is selected and exercises the functions of a forward/reverse selecting mechanism when the drive range D or the reverse range R is selected. Whereas the conventional automobile driving system needs special double-pinion planetary gears respectively for a center differential gear and a forward/reverse selecting mechanism, the automobile driving system in the sixth embodiment according to the present invention needs a single double-pinion planetary gear for both the functions of the center differential gear and those of the forward/reverse selecting mechanism. Therefore, the automobile driving system in the sixth embodiment according to the present invention exercises high performance, has a simple, compact, lightweight construction having a small overall length, simplifies control operations, and can be manufactured at a low manufacturing cost. Accordingly, the automobile driving system can be installed on a vehicle body with only a small portion or no portion thereof projected into a tunnel formed under a passenger room to reduce greatly the sectional area of the portion of the tunnel protruding into the passenger room, a sufficiently large space can be secured between the toe board and the automobile driving system, and a sufficiently large space can be secured to form a passenger room which provides improved comfortability. Since an increased space is secured between the toe board and the automobile driving system, a sufficient crush stroke necessary for protecting the passenger in the case of collision can be secured, and a sufficiently large space is available for work for installing the transmission in and removing the same from the engine room. Furthermore, the degree of freedom of vehicle body design is increased and the automobile driving system can be mounted on a slant nose body having a low engine hood. An electromagnetic clutch or a wet clutch may be employed instead of the torque converter 620. If an electromagnetic clutch or a wet clutch is employed instead of the torque converter, the transmission of power to the primary shaft 631 of the belt-drive variable-speed transmission 630 and beyond the belt-drive variable-speed transmission 630 can be intercepted when the neutral position N or the parking position P is selected. It is known from the comparative examination of the automobile driving system 600 in the sixth embodiment for a four-wheel drive vehicle and the automobile driving system 200 in the second embodiment for a two-wheel drive vehicle that the torque converter, the belt-drive variable-speed transmission, the front differential gear, the first, the second and the fifth case forming the transmission case containing the belt-drive variable-speed transmission, and the principal components of the transfer unit including the front drive shaft, the double-pinion planetary gear, the fixed shaft, and the first and the second multiple-disk clutch are common to the automobile driving system 600 in the sixth embodiment for a four-wheel drive vehicle and the automobile driving system 200 in the second embodiment for a two-wheel drive vehicle. Therefore, the principal portions of the automobile driving system for a four-wheel drive vehicle can be constructed relatively easily at a reduced manufacturing cost by additionally incorporating the power transmitting mechanism for transmitting power to the rear differential gear including the third, the fourth and the fifth clutch, the transfer drive gear and the rear drive shaft into the automobile driving system 200 in the second embodiment for a two-wheel drive vehicle. Seventh Embodiment A driving system 700 in a seventh embodiment according to the present invention for a four-wheel drive vehicle will be described hereinafter with reference to FIGS. 57 to 65. Referring to FIG. 57, in the automobile driving system 700 in the seventh embodiment for a four-wheel drive vehicle, a torque converter case 701 joined to a transverse engine 710 to contain a torque converter 720, a variable-speed transmission housing 702 disposed beside the torque converter case 701 and containing a belt-drive variable-speed transmission 730 and a front differential gear 740, a side cover 703, a case 704 and an end cover 705 combined with the torque converter case 701 to contain a transfer unit 750, an extension case 706 disposed behind the torque converter case 701 to contain a power transmitting mechanism for transmitting the output of the transfer unit 750 to rear wheels are arranged and joined successively in that order to construct a transmission case 707. An oil pan, not shown, is attached to a lower portion of the transmission case 707. The transverse engine 710 has a crankshaft 711 connected to the torque converter 720 contained in the torque converter case 701. An output shaft 721 associated with the torque converter 720 is coupled with a primary shaft 731 included in the belt-drive variable-speed transmission 730 contained in the variable-speed transmission case 702 to transmit power from the crankshaft 711 through the torque converter 720 to the primary shaft 731 of the variable-speed transmission 730. The variable-speed transmission 730 converts an input rotating speed to an output rotating speed of a secondary shaft 732. Power is transmitted from the secondary shaft 732 through a countershaft assembly 739 to the transfer unit 750. The transfer unit 750 transfers power through the front differential gear 740 to front wheels and through a propeller shaft 7116 and a rear differential gear 7117 to rear wheels. An oil pump 708 which is driven continuously by an oil pump drive shaft 724a included in the torque converter 720 is contained in the transmission case 707. The oil pump 708 discharges oil at a line pressure continuously to supply the oil to the torque converter 720 and associated parts, enables the hydraulic control of the variable-speed transmission 730, and enables the hydraulic control of the transfer unit 750 by a hydraulic controller 709 on the basis of signals provided by a traveling speed sensor 709a, a throttle opening sensor 709b, a shift switch 709c, a front wheel speed sensor 709d, a rear wheel speed sensor 709e and a steering angle sensor 709f. The torque converter 720, the belt-type variable-speed transmission 730, the front differential gear 740 and the transfer unit 750 will be successively described with reference to FIGS. 58 to 60. As shown in FIG. 58 in a sectional view, the torque converter 720 has the output shaft 721 supported for rotation in ball bearings 721a on the variable-speed transmission housing 702 and the side cover 703 coaxially with the crankshaft 711. The output shaft 721 is surrounded so as to be rotatable by a stator shaft 722 having a substantially cylindrical outer circumference, and provided at its base end with a flange bolted to the variable-speed transmission case 701 through an oil pump housing 708c. The oil pump drive shaft 724a joined to an impeller 724 is fitted rotatably on the stator shaft 722. The outer circumference of the impeller 724 is joined to the outer circumference of a front cover 725 and connected by a drive plate 726 to the crankshaft 711 so as to rotate together with the crankshaft 711. A turbine 727 is disposed opposite to the impeller 724 and is coupled with the output shaft 721 by splines. A stator 728 is interposed between the impeller 724 and the turbine 727 and is supported on a one-way clutch 728a mounted on the stator shaft 722. A lock-up clutch 729 is interposed between the turbine 727 and the front cover 725. The oil pump 708 comprising an inner gear 708a driven for rotation by the oil pump drive shaft 724a, an outer gear 708b engaged with the inner gear 708a, and an oil pump housing 708c is mounted on the base end of the stator shaft 722. The rotation of the crankshaft 711 of the engine 710 is transmitted through the drive plate 726 bolted to the crankshaft 711, and the front cover 725 to the impeller 724 to drive the same for rotation. As the impeller 724 rotates, the oil is discharged outside from the impeller 724 by centrifugal force, the oil flows into the turbine 727 to transmit a torque acting in the same direction as the rotating direction of the impeller 724 to the turbine 727, so that the output shaft 721 coupled by the splines with the turbine 727 is driven for rotation. The direction of flow of the oil flowing out from the turbine 727 is deflected by the stator 728 in a direction to assist the rotation of the impeller 724 to increase the torque of the impeller 724. If the turbine 727 rotates at a high rotating speed, the oil flows against the back surface of the stator 728 to make the stator 728 rotate freely on the one-way clutch 728a. When a fixed traveling speed or rotating speed is achieved, the lock-up clutch 729 engages the impeller 724 and the turbine 727 through the front cover 725 to make the torque converter operate without slipping; consequently, the operating speed of the engine 710 is reduced accordingly, whereby fuel consumption is reduced and silence is improved. The belt-drive variable-speed transmission 730 has a primary shaft 731, a secondary shaft 732 disposed in parallel to the primary shaft 731, a primary pulley 733 mounted on the primary shaft 731, a secondary pulley 734 mounted on the secondary shaft 732, and a drive belt 735 extended between the primary pulley 733 and the secondary pulley 734. The respective widths of the grooves of the primary pulley 733 and the secondary pulley 734 are varied to vary the ratio between the pitch diameters of the primary pulley 733 and the secondary pulley 734 for continuously variable speed change. The primary pulley 733 mounted on the primary shaft 731 formed integrally with the output shaft 721 has a fixed cone 733a formed integrally with the primary shaft 731 and a movable cone 733b axially movable relative to the fixed cone 733a. The fixed cone 733a and the movable cone 733b must hold the drive belt 735 by a predetermined clamping force and the width of the groove defined by the fixed cone 733a and the movable cone 733b must be smoothly controllable to ensure the smooth operation of the transmission for continuously variable speed change. Therefore, a plurality of axial grooves are formed in the mating surfaces of the primary shaft 731 and the movable cone 733b, and balls 733c are placed in the mating grooves for torque transmission. A substantially cylindrical first piston 737a is fixed to the back surface of the movable cone 733b, i.e., a surface not facing the fixed cone 733a, a pressure chamber 737A is formed by the first piston 737a and a cylinder 737b having the shape of a bottomed cylinder and having a central portion fixed to the primary shaft 731. The movable cone 733b is biased by a hydraulic actuator 737 including a spring 737c toward the fixed cone 733a. An oil passage 731b is formed in the primary shaft 731 so as to be connected to the pressure chamber 737A. The hydraulic controller 709 executes a control operation on the basis of signals representing the opening of the throttle and such to supply the oil into and to discharge the same from the pressure chamber 637A of the hydraulic actuator 737 through an oil passage 703a formed in the side cover 703 to move the movable cone 733b along the primary shaft 731 to vary the width of the groove of the pulley. The secondary shaft 732 extended in parallel to the primary shaft 731 is supported for rotation in a roller bearing 732a and a ball bearing 732b on the variable-speed transmission housing 702 and the side cover 703. The secondary pulley 734 mounted on the secondary shaft 732 has a fixed cone 734a formed integrally with the secondary shaft 732, and a movable cone 734b axially movable relative to the fixed cone 734a. A plurality of axial grooves are formed in the mating surfaces of the movable cone 734b and the secondary shaft 732, and balls 734c are placed in the mating axial grooves for torque transmission from the secondary pulley 734 to the secondary shaft 732. A substantially cylindrical cylinder 736a is fixed to the back surface of the movable cone 734b, a pressure chamber 736A is defined by the cylinder 736a and a cylindrical piston 736b having a central portion fixed to the secondary shaft 732, and the movable cone 734b is biased toward the fixed cone 734a by a spring 736c included in a hydraulic actuator 736. An oil passage 732b is formed in the secondary shaft 732 so as to be connected to the pressure chamber 736A. The hydraulic controller 709 executes a control operation on the basis of signals representing the opening of the throttle and such to supply the oil into and to discharge the same from the pressure chamber 736A of the hydraulic actuator 736 through an oil passage 703b formed in the side cover 703. A drive gear 738 is mounted on one end of the secondary shaft 732. The pressure receiving area of the movable cone 733b of the primary pulley 733 is greater than that of the movable cone 734b of the secondary pulley 734. Therefore, when the oil is supplied into and discharged from the pressure chambers 737A and 736A, the mode of variation of the width of the groove of the primary pulley 733 and that of the width of the groove of the secondary pulley 734 are reverse to each other. Thus, the ratio between the pitch diameters of the primary pulley 733 and the secondary pulley 734 is varied continuously to vary the output rotating speed of the secondary shaft 732 continuously. The rotation of the secondary shaft 732 is transmitted through the drive gear 738 to the countershaft assembly 739 at a reduced rotating speed. The rotation of the countershaft assembly 739 is transmitted through a driven gear 754 and a power transmission shaft 753 connected to the driven gear 754 to the transfer unit 750. The countershaft assembly 739 comprises a shaft 739a supported at its opposite ends in a needle bearing 739e and a roller bearing 739f on the torque converter case 701 and the variable-speed transmission housing 702, a driven gear 739c of a relatively large diameter fixedly mounted on the shaft 739a for rotation together with the shaft 739a and engaged with the drive gear 738, and a drive gear 739d formed integrally with the shaft 739a and engaged with the driven gear 754. The respective constructions of the front differential gear 740 and the transfer unit 750 will be described hereinafter with reference to FIG. 58 and FIG. 59 showing an essential portion of a construction shown in FIG. 58 in an enlarged view. The front differential gear 740 is contained in a differential gear housing 741 formed between a driven gear 754 having a cylindrical boss 754a supported in a ball bearing 754b on the variable-speed transmission housing 702, and a substantially cylindrical transmission shaft 753 supported for rotation in a ball bearing 753a on the torque converter case 701. The front differential gear 740 has a hollow, differential gear case 742 rotatably fitted in an expanded part formed of the substantially cylindrical boss 754a of the driven gear 754 formed integrally with a front drive shaft 751, and the transmission shaft 753. A pair of pinions 743b are disposed in the differential gear case 742 and supported on a pinion shaft 743a supported at opposite ends thereof on the differential gear case 742. A left side gear 743c and a right side gear 743d are engaged with the pair of pinions 743b to constitute a differential gear 743. A drive shaft 744 connected to the side gear 743c extends through the differential gear case 742 and the variable-speed transmission housing 702, and transmits power through a constant-velocity joint and an axle to one of the front wheels. A drive shaft 745 connected to the other side gear 743d extends through the differential gear case 742 and the front drive shaft 751 formed integrally with the differential gear case 742, projects from the end cover 705 and transmits power through a constant-velocity joint and an axle to the other front wheel. The transfer unit 750 has the front drive shaft 751, i.e., a first drive shaft, parallel to the crankshaft 711 of the engine 710, the output shaft 721, the primary shaft 731 and the secondary shaft 732, and a rear drive shaft 752, i.e., a second drive shaft. The crankshaft 711, the primary shaft 731, the secondary shaft 732, the front drive shaft 751 and the rear drive shaft 752 extended in parallel to each other are arranged as shown in FIG. 60 in a view taken in the direction of the arrow A in FIG. 58; the crankshaft 711 having an axis 711a of rotation and the primary shaft 731 are extended coaxially along the width of the vehicle body, the secondary shaft 732 is disposed behind and in parallel to the primary shaft 731 on a level higher than that of the primary shaft 731, the front drive shaft 751 is disposed below the secondary shaft 732, and the rear drive shaft 752 is disposed behind the front drive shaft 751. Thus, the driving system is formed in a compact construction having relatively small transverse and longitudinal dimensions to facilitate the installation of the driving system in the engine room and to improve the compatibility of the driving system with both a vehicle body designed to be mounted with a manual transmission (MT) and a vehicle body designed to be mounted with an automatic transmission (AT). The front drive shaft 751 formed integrally with the differential gear case 742 has one end rotatably supported through the transmission shaft 753 and the ball bearing 753a supporting the transmission shaft 753 on the torque converter case 701, and the other end rotatably supported in a needle bearing 751c on the end cover 705. The front drive shaft 751 is provided in a middle portion thereof with splines 751a which engage with a sun gear 756 included in a double-pinion planetary gear 755, and splines 751b which engage with a clutch drum 794 included in a fourth multiple-disk clutch 793, i.e., a fourth friction coupling element. A transfer driven gear 752a is mounted on one end of the rear drive shaft 752 disposed in parallel to the front drive shaft 751, and a bevel gear 752b, which engages with a bevel gear 7113a mounted on one end of an output shaft 7113, is mounted on the other end of the rear drive shaft 752. The rear drive shaft 752 is supported for rotation in a plurality of ball bearings 752c on the torque converter case 701 and the end cover 705 of the transmission case 707. The double-pinion planetary gear 755 has the sun gear 756 engaged with the splines 751a formed in the middle portion of the front drive shaft 751, a ring gear 757, a first pinion 758 engaged with the sun gear 756, a second pinion 759 engaged with the ring gear 757 and the first pinion 758, and a carrier 760 supporting the first pinion 758 and the second pinion 759 for rotation thereon in needle bearings 760a. Power applied to the ring gear 757 is distributed to the sun gear 756 and the carrier 760 at a torque distribution ratio dependent on the dimensions of the sun gear 756 and the ring gear 757. When the ring gear 757 is fastened to the transmission case 707, the sun gear 756 is rotated in a direction opposite the rotating direction of the carrier 760. The sun gear 756 is held between a thrust bearing 761a supported on the transmission shaft 753, and a thrust bearing 761b supported through a ball bearing 782a and a transfer drive gear 782 on the case 704 to restrain the axial movement of the double-pinion planetary gear 755. The front drive shaft 751 is inserted in a substantially cylindrical fixed shaft 762 formed integrally with the torque converter case 701. A space between the inner circumference of the fixed shaft 762 and the front drive shaft 751 is closed by a clutch drum 769 included in a first multiple-disk clutch 768, i.e., a first friction coupling element, to form a pressure chamber 762A. The fixed shaft 762 is provided with an oil passage 762a connected to the pressure chamber 762A, and an oil passage 762b formed in its outer circumference. An input selecting means 767 for selectively transmitting power from the transmission shaft 753 to the ring gear 757 or the carrier 760 is interposed between the transmission shaft 753 and the double-pinion planetary gear 755. The input selecting means 567 comprises the first multiple-disk clutch 768 and the second multiple-disk clutch 778, i.e., a second friction coupling element. In the first multiple-disk clutch 768, a clutch drum 769 supported for rotation on the fixed shaft 762 is engaged with splines 753b formed in one end portion of the transmission shaft 753, and a clutch hub 770 is connected to the ring gear 757 of the double-pinion planetary gear 755. The first multiple-disk clutch 768 interlocks the transmission shaft 753 and the ring gear 757 for power transmission. A pressure is applied to a pressure chamber 771 to compress a retaining plate 773c contiguous with a snap ring 773d, driven plates 773b and drive plates 773a by a piston 772 to engage the first multiple-disk clutch 768 for power transmission. Indicated at 772a is a sealing member fitted on the piston 772 and capable of providing liquid-tight sealing between the piston 772 and the clutch drum 769 and of sliding along the clutch drum 769. A retainer 775a is disposed on one side of the piston 772 opposite the other side of the same on which the pressure chamber 771 is formed, and a pressure is exerted through a piston 774 on the piston 772 by a return spring 776. In the second multiple-disk clutch 778, the clutch drum 769 of the first multiple-disk clutch 768 serves also as the clutch drum of the second multiple-disk clutch 778, and the clutch hub 779 is connected to the carrier 760 of the double-pinion planetary gear 755. The second multiple-disk clutch 778 interlocks the transmission shaft 753 and the carrier 760 for power transmission. A pressure is applied to a pressure chamber 780 to compress a retaining plate 781c contiguous with a snap ring 781d fixed to the piston 772, driven plates 781b and drive plates 781a coupled with the clutch hub 779 by the piston 772 to engage the second multiple-disk clutch 778 for power transmission. A centrifugal pressure generated in the pressure chamber 780 is counterbalanced with a pressure in a balancing pressure chamber 775. A pressure is exerted on the piston 774 by the return spring 776. The transfer drive gear 782 is supported for rotation by a ball bearing 782a on the case 704 of the transmission case 707 and by a needle bearing 782b on the front drive shaft 751 on one side of the double-pinion planetary gear 755 opposite the other side of the same on which the input selecting means 767 is disposed. The transfer driven gear 752a mounted on the rear drive shaft 752 is engaged with the transfer drive gear 782 for power transmission. A third multiple-disk clutch 784, i.e., a third friction coupling element for selectively transmitting power from the carrier 760 of the double-pinion planetary gear 755 to the transfer drive gear 782, is interposed between the double-pinion planetary gear 755 and the transfer drive gear 782. The third multiple-disk clutch 784 has a drum 785 coupled with the transfer drive gear 782 by splines, and a clutch hub 786 connected to the carrier 760 of the double-pinion planetary gear 755. The third multiple-disk clutch 784 transmits power from the carrier 760 to the transfer drive gear 782. A pressure is applied to a pressure chamber 787 to compress a retaining plate 789c contiguous with a snap ring 789d fixed to the clutch drum 785, driven plates 789b and drive plates 789a coupled with the clutch hub 786 by a piston 788 to engage the third multiple-disk clutch 784 for power transmission. A retainer 790 is disposed on one side of the piston 788 opposite the other side of the same on which the pressure chamber 787 is formed to form a balancing pressure chamber 791 for counterbalancing a centrifugal pressure generated in the pressure chamber 787. A pressure is exerted on the piston 788 by a return spring 792. The fourth multiple-disk clutch 793, i.e., a fourth coupling element for selectively interlocking the front drive shaft 751 and the transfer drive gear 782 for power transmission, is interposed between the rear end of the front drive shaft 751 and the transfer drive gear 782. The fourth multiple-disk clutch 793 has a clutch drum 794 coupled with the front drive shaft 751 by the splines 751b formed on the front drive shaft 751, and a clutch hub 795 connected to the transfer derive gear 782 for power transmission. A pressure is applied to a pressure chamber 796 to compress a retaining plate 798c contiguous with a snap ring 798d fixed to the clutch drum 794, driven plates 798b and drive plates 798a coupled with the clutch hub 795 by a piston 797 to engage the fourth multiple-disk clutch 793 for power transmission. A retainer 799 is disposed so as to form a balancing pressure chamber 7100 for counterbalancing a centrifugal pressure generated in the pressure chamber 796. A pressure is exerted on the piston 797 by a return spring 7101. A fifth multiple-disk clutch 7102, i.e., a fifth friction coupling element for selectively fastening the ring gear 757 to the case 704 of the transmission case 707, is interposed between the case 704 of the transmission case 707 and the ring gear 757 of the double-pinion planetary gear 755. A pressure is applied to a pressure chamber 7103 to compress a retaining plate 7105c contiguous with a snap ring 7105d fixed to the case 704, driven plates 7105b and drive plates 7105a coupled with the clutch hub 770 connected to the ring gear 757 by a piston 7104 to engage the fifth multiple-disk clutch 7102 to fasten the ring gear 757 to the transmission case 707. A pressure is exerted on the piston 7104 by a return spring 7106. An output shaft 7113 is supported in a pair of bearings 7112 spaced a predetermined distance apart by a spacer 7111 and supported on the extension case 706 by a retainer 7110 in the extension case 706 connected to the rear end of the torque converter case 701. The bevel gear 7113a is mounted on the front end of the output shaft 7113 and is engaged with the bevel gear 752a mounted on the rear drive shaft 752. The rear end of the output shaft 7113 is connected through a universal coupling and a propeller shaft 7116 to the rear differential gear 7117 to transmit power to the rear differential gear 7117. A control valve is disposed in the oil pan joined to a lower portion of the transmission case 707. The control valve is controlled by the hydraulic controller 709 on the basis of signals provided by the traveling speed sensor 709a, the throttle opening sensor 709b, the shift switch 709c, the front wheel speed sensor 709d, the rear wheel speed sensor 709e and the steering angle sensor 709f to supply the oil discharged from the oil pump selectively to the input selecting means 767, the respective pressure chambers 771, 780, 787, 796 and 7103 of the first multiple-disk clutch 768, the second multiple-disk clutch 778, the third multiple-disk clutch 784, the fourth multiple-disk clutch 793 and the fifth multiple-disk clutch 7102, and the variable-speed transmission 730. The operation of the automobile driving system for a four-wheel drive vehicle thus constructed will be described with reference to FIGS. 61 to 64, and FIG. 56 tabulating the operating conditions of the first multiple-disk clutch 768, the second multiple-disk clutch 778. third multiple-disk clutch 784, the fourth multiple-disk clutch 793 and the fifth multiple-disk clutch 7102. In the table shown in FIG. 65, blank circles indicate that the corresponding multiple-disk clutches are engaged or operative, and parenthesized blank circles indicate that multiple-disk clutches are engaged or operative if necessary. The power of the engine 710 is transmitted from the crankshaft 711 through the torque converter 720 to the primary shaft 731 of the variable-speed transmission 730. An input speed of the primary shaft 731 is converted continuously into an output speed of the secondary shaft 732 by the action of the primary pulley 733 and the secondary pulley 734 operatively connected by the drive belt 735. The output speed of the secondary shaft 732 is reduced by the action of the drive gear 738, the countershaft assembly 739 and the driven gear 754. and a reduced speed is transmitted through the clutch drum 769 to the first multiple-disk clutch 768 and the second multiple-disk clutch 778. The first multiple-disk clutch 768 and the second multiple-disk clutch 778 are disengaged and power is not transmitted beyond the first multiple-disk clutch 768 and the second multiple-disk clutch 778 when a neutral position N or a parking position P is selected. When a drive range D, i.e., a forward range, is selected, the first multiple-disk clutch 768 and the third multiple-disk clutch 784 are engaged to transmit driving power through a drive line indicated by thick lines in FIG. 61. A pressure is applied through the control valve to the pressure chamber 771 to compress the retaining plate 773c contiguous with the snap ring 773d fixed to the inner circumference of the clutch drum 769, the driven plates 773b, and the drive plates 773a by the piston 772 so that the first multiple-disk clutch 768 is engaged. Consequently, power is transmitted from the transmission shaft 753 to the ring gear 757 of the double-pinion planetary gear 755. A pressure is applied also to the pressure chamber 787 to compress the retaining plate 789c, the snap ring 789d, the driven plate 789b and the drive plate 789a of the third multiple-disk clutch 784 by the piston 788 to engage the third multiple-disk clutch 784. Consequently, the carrier 760 of the double-pinion planetary gear 755 and the transfer drive gear 782 are interlocked for power transmission through the third multiple-disk clutch 784. Accordingly, in the double-pinion planetary gear 755 in which the ring gear 757, i.e., input member, and the first pinion 758 are engaged, and the second pinion 759 is engaged with the first pinion 758 and the sun gear 756 as shown in FIG. 62, the sun gear 756 and the carrier 760 are rotated for differential rotation in the same direction as the rotating direction of the ring gear 757, and torque is distributed at a predetermined distribution ratio to the sun gear 756 and the carrier 760. Thus the front drive shaft 751 coupled with the sun gear 756 by splines and the transfer drive gear 782 operatively connected to the carrier 760 are rotated in the rotating direction of the ring gear 757, and the transfer drive gear 752a engaged with the transfer drive gear 782 is rotated to drive the rear drive shaft 752 for rotation in a direction opposite the rotating direction of the ring gear 757. During torque transmission, the double-pinion planetary gear 755 serves as a center differential gear in which the first pinion 758 and the second pinion 759 rotate and revolve round the sun gear 756 to absorb the difference in rotating speed between the sun gear 756 and the carrier 760. The torque distributing function of the double-pinion planetary gear 755 will be described with reference FIG. 62. The relation between torque distribution and the numbers of teeth of the ring gear 757 and the sun gear 756 is expressed by: where Ti is input torque applied to the ring gear 757, TF is the torque of the sun gear 756 to be transmitted to the front wheels, TR is the torque of the carrier 760 to be transmitted to the rear wheels, ZS is the number of teeth of the sun gear 756 and ZR is the number of teeth of the ring gear 757. Accordingly, an optional reference torque distribution ratio TF/TR can be provided by properly determining ZS of the sun gear 756 and ZR of the ring gear 757. which signifies that about 45% and about 55% of the input torque applied to the ring gear 757 of the double-pinion planetary gear 755 are distributed to the front wheels and the rear wheels, respectively. Thus, a rear-biased reference torque distribution mode, i.e., a torque distribution mode in which a major part of the input torque is distributed to the rear wheels, can be established. A pressure is applied to the pressure chamber 796 of the fourth multiple-disk clutch 793 to compress the snap ring 798d, the retaining plate 798c, the driven plate 798b and the drive plat 798a by the piston 797 to produce clutch torque Tc. The hydraulic controller 709 controls the control valve to vary the clutch torque Tc. Front wheel speed NF and rear wheel speed NR measured by the front wheel speed sensor 709d and the rear wheel speed sensor 709e are given to the hydraulic controller 709. The rear wheels always starts slipping first if the vehicle is traveling on a slippery road in the rear-biased reference torque distribution mode, i.e., in a mode in which TF<TR. Therefore, slip S is defined by S=NF/NR (S>0). A clutch pressure Pc corresponding to a slip S and a steering angle .PSI. given to the hydraulic controller 709 from the steering angle sensor 709f is retrieved from a map stored in the hydraulic controller 709. If the rear wheels are not slipping and S.gtoreq.1, the clutch pressure Pc is relatively low. If the rear wheels are slipping and S<1, the clutch pressure Pc is increased as the slip S decreases, and the clutch pressure Pc is set to Pmax when the slip S is not greater than a predetermined threshold slip S1. The line pressure is adjusted to the clutch pressure Pc for the variable control of the clutch torque Tc of the fourth multiple-disk clutch 793. Thus, a bypass drive line 7115 is formed by engaging the fourth multiple-disk clutch 793. The bypass drive line 7115 extends from the front drive shaft 751 through the transfer drive gear 782 to the sun gear 756. The bypass drive line 7115 exercises a differential function to meet (rear wheel speed NR)>(rotating speed of the ring gear 757)>(front wheel speed NF) in the transfer unit 750 if the rear wheels slip, and the torque transmitted through the fourth multiple-disk clutch 793 to the front drive shaft 751 is increased by the clutch torque Tc, and the torque transmitted through the transfer driven gear 752a engaged with the transfer drive gear 782 to the rear drive shaft 752 is reduced by the clutch torque Tc distributed to the front wheels. Consequently, Accordingly, the torque is distributed to the front wheels and the rear wheels at a rear-biased torque distribution ratio TF:TR.apprxeq.45:55 when neither the front wheels nor the rear wheels are slipping because the clutch torque Tc=0 if neither the front wheels nor the rear wheels are slipping. When the rear wheels are slipping and the clutch torque Tc is generated, more part of the input torque Ti is distributed to the front wheels through the bypass drive line 7115 shown in FIG. 62 if the clutch torque Tc is greater, and the torque distribution ratio TF:TR changes to TF1:TR1 as shown in FIG. 45 so that the torque distributed to the front wheels is increased positively and the torque distributed to the rear wheels is decreased. Consequently, the slip of the rear wheels is decreased and the traction of the vehicle is improved. When the slip S is decreased below the predetermined threshold slip, the pressure of the oil supplied to the fourth multiple-disk clutch 793 increases, differential limiting torque increases to a maximum, and the sun gear 756 and the carrier 760 are connected directly. Consequently, the differential motion of the transfer unit 750 is locked and a direct four-wheel-drive mode in which the torque is distributed at a torque distribution ratio corresponding to front-rear axle weight distribution ratio is established, whereby the traction of the vehicle is enhanced to a maximum. If the front wheels slip, the differential function of the transfer unit 750 meets a condition: (rear wheel speed NR)<(rotating speed of the ring gear 757)<(front wheel speed NF), a torque is transmitted from the front drive shaft 751 to the transfer drive gear 782 according to the clutch torque Tc, and the torque transmitted from the front drive shaft 751 to the front wheels is reduced by the clutch torque Tc distributed to the rear wheels. Consequently, Accordingly, the torque is distributed to the front wheels and the rear wheels at a rear-biased torque distribution ratio TF:TR.apprxeq.45:55 when neither the front wheels nor the rear wheels are slipping because the clutch torque Tc=0 if neither the front wheels nor the rear wheels are slipping. When the front wheels are slipping and the clutch torque Tc is generated, the input torque Ti is distributed to the rear wheels according to the clutch torque Tc to increase the torque distributed to the rear wheels positively and to reduce the torque distributed to the front wheels, so that the traction of the vehicle is improved. If the slip S is decreased below the predetermined threshold slip, the pressure of the oil supplied to the fourth multiple-disk clutch 793 increases, differential limiting torque increases to a maximum, and the sun gear 756 and the carrier 760 are connected directly. Consequently, a direct four-wheel-drive mode in which the torque is distributed at a torque distribution ratio corresponding to front-rear axle weight distribution ratio is established, whereby the traction of the vehicle is fully enhanced. Thus, the torques distributed to the front and the rear wheels are controlled in a wide range according to the mode of slip to avoid the reduction of traction. If the vehicle turns during the torque distribution control for suppressing slip, the differential limiting torque of the fourth multiple-disk clutch 793 is reduced for correction according to the steering angle .PSI.. Consequently, the differential limiting effect of the transfer unit 750 is reduced and the difference in rotating speed can be satisfactorily absorbed, so that tight corner braking is avoided and satisfactory controllability can be secured. When a reverse range R is selected, the first multiple-disk clutch 768 and the third multiple-disk clutch 784 are disengaged and the second multiple-disk clutch 778, the fourth multiple-disk clutch 793 and the fifth multiple-disk clutch 7102 are engaged to transmit power through a drive line indicated by thick lines in FIG. 63. A pressure is applied through the control valve to the pressure chamber 780 to compress the snap ring 781d, the retaining plate 781c, the drive plates 781a and the driven plates 781b by the piston 774 to engage the second multiple-disk clutch 778 to interlock the transmission shaft 753 and the carrier 760 of the double-pinion planetary gear 755 for power transmission. A pressure is applied to the pressure chamber 7103 to compress the snap ring 7105d, the retaining plate 7105c, the drive plates 7105a and the driven plates 7105b by the piston 7104 to engage the fifth multiple-disk clutch 7102, whereby the ring gear 757 is fastened to the transmission case 707. The snap ring 798d, the retaining plate 798c, the drive plates 798a and the driven plates 798b are compressed by the piston 797 to engage the fourth multiple-disk clutch 793, so that power is transmitted from the front drive shaft 751 to the transfer drive gear 782. Consequently, as shown in FIG. 64, the first pinion 758 and the second pinion 759 are rotated in the opposite directions, respectively, by the carrier 760 and revolve along the ring gear 757 to rotate the sun gear 756 in a direction opposite the rotating direction of the carrier 760. Consequently, the front drive shaft 751 is driven for rotation in the reverse direction, power is transmitted from the front drive shaft 751 through the fourth multiple-disk clutch 793 to the transfer drive gear 782 to drive the rear drive shaft 752 for rotation in a direction opposite the rotating direction of the front drive shaft 751. Therefore, the power transmitted to the transmission shaft 753 is transmitted in a direction opposite a direction in which power is transmitted when the drive range D is selected to the front drive shaft 751 and the rear drive shaft 752 when the ring gear 757 of the double-pinion planetary gear 755 is fastened to the transmission case 707 by the fifth multiple-disk clutch 7102. Thus, the double-pinion planetary gear 755 is capable of a forward/reverse selecting function. In this case, power is transmitted from the carrier 760 to the front drive shaft 751 and the rear drive shaft 752 at a gear ratio expressed by: which is an appropriate gear ratio for the reverse range R. The input torque Ti applied to the carrier 760 is transmitted to the transfer drive gear 782 according to the clutch torque Tc, and the rest of the input torque Ti is transmitted to the front wheels. Therefore, the traction of the vehicle is improved by reducing the clutch torque Tc so that part of the input torque Ti distributed to the front wheels is increased positively and the torque distributed to the rear wheels is decreased when the rear wheels slip in order that the slip is suppressed and satisfactory traction can be secured. When the front wheels slip, the clutch torque Tc is increased to distribute more part of the input torque Ti to the rear wheels to increase the torque of the rear wheels positively and the torque distributed to the front wheels is reduced to suppress slip and to improve traction. If the slip S is decreased blow the predetermined threshold slip, the pressure of the oil supplied to the fourth multiple-disk clutch 793 is increased to a maximum and the differential limiting torque Tc is increased to a maximum to connect the front drive shaft 751 and the transfer drive gear 782 directly to establish a direct four-wheel-drive mode in which the torque is distributed at a torque distribution ratio corresponding to front-rear axle weight distribution ratio, whereby the traction of the vehicle is fully enhanced. If the vehicle turns during the torque distribution control for suppressing slip, the differential limiting torque of the fourth multiple-disk clutch 793 is reduced according to the steering angle .PSI.. Consequently, the difference in rotating speed can be satisfactorily absorbed, so that tight corner braking is avoided and satisfactory controllability can be secured. In the seventh embodiment, the front drive shaft 751 and the rear drive shaft 752 for transmitting power to the front differential gear 740 connected to the output side of the belt-drive variable-speed transmission 730 and the rear differential gear 7117, respectively, are disposed in parallel to the crankshaft 711 of the transverse engine 710, the double-pinion planetary gear 755 is mounted on the front drive shaft 751 with its sun gear 756 coupled with the front drive shaft 751, the first multiple-disk clutch 768 is capable of transmitting the output of the variable-speed transmission 730 to the ring gear 757, the second multiple-disk clutch 778 is capable of transmitting the output of the variable-speed transmission 730 to the carrier 760, the third multiple-disk clutch 784 is capable of interlocking the carrier 760 and the transfer drive gear 782 for power transmission, the fourth multiple-disk clutch 793 is capable of connecting the front drive shaft 751 and the rear drive shaft 752 for power transmission, the fifth multiple-disk clutch 7102 is capable of restraining the ring gear 757 from rotation, and the multiple-disk clutches 768, 778, 784, 793 and 7102 are controlled selectively so that the automobile driving system exercises the functions of a center differential gear to distribute torques properly to the front drive shaft 751 and the rear drive shaft 752 and to achieve a differential limiting operation so that the vehicle is able to travel satisfactorily when the drive range D, i.e., the forward range, or the reverse range R is selected and exercises the functions of a forward/reverse selecting mechanism when the drive range D or the reverse range R is selected. Whereas the conventional automobile driving system needs special double-pinion planetary gears respectively for a center differential gear and a forward/reverse selecting mechanism, the automobile driving system in the seventh embodiment according to the present invention needs a single double-pinion planetary gear for both the functions of the center differential gear and those of the forward/reverse selecting mechanism. Therefore, the automobile driving system in the seventh embodiment according to the present invention exercises high performance, has a simple, compact, lightweight construction having a small overall length along the width of the vehicle body, simplifies control operations, and can be manufactured at a low manufacturing cost. Accordingly, the automobile driving system can be installed on a vehicle body with a sufficiently large space secured between the side walls of the engine room and the opposite ends thereof, so that a sufficient crush stroke necessary for protecting the passenger in the case of lateral collision can be secured, and a sufficiently large space is available for work for installing the transmission in and removing the same from the engine room. Furthermore, the degree of freedom of vehicle body design is increased. An electromagnetic clutch or a wet clutch may be employed instead of the torque converter 720. If an electromagnetic clutch or a wet clutch is employed instead of the torque converter 720, the transmission of power to the primary shaft 731 of the belt-drive variable-speed transmission 730 and beyond the belt-drive variable-speed transmission 730 can be intercepted when the neutral position N or the parking position P is selected. It is known from the comparative examination of the automobile driving system 700 in the seventh embodiment for a four-wheel drive vehicle and the automobile driving system 300 in the third embodiment for a two-wheel drive vehicle that the torque converter, the belt-drive variable-speed transmission, the front differential gear, the first, the second and the fifth case forming the transmission case containing the torque converter and the belt-drive variable-speed transmission, and the principal components of the transfer unit including the front drive shaft, the double-pinion planetary gear, the fixed shaft, and the first and the second multiple-disk clutch are common to the automobile driving system 700 in the seventh embodiment for a four-wheel drive vehicle and the automobile driving system 300 in the third embodiment for a two-wheel drive vehicle. Therefore, the principal portions of the automobile driving system for a four-wheel drive vehicle can be constructed relatively easily at a reduced manufacturing cost by additionally incorporating the power transmitting mechanism for transmitting power to the rear differential gear including the third, the fourth and the fifth clutch, the transfer drive gear and the rear drive shaft into the automobile driving system 300 in the third embodiment for a two-wheel drive vehicle. Eighth Embodiment A driving system 800 in an eighth embodiment according to the present invention for a four-wheel drive vehicle will be described hereinafter with reference to FIGS. 66 to 73. Referring to FIG. 66, in the automobile driving system 700 in the eighth embodiment for a four-wheel drive vehicle, a torque converter case 801 joined to a transverse engine 810 to contain a torque converter 820, a variable-speed transmission housing 802 and a case 803 disposed beside the torque converter case 801 and containing a belt-drive variable-speed transmission 830 and a front differential gear 840, a case 804 and an end cover 805 combined with the torque converter case 801 to contain a transfer unit 850, an extension case 806 disposed behind the torque converter case 801 to contain a power transmitting mechanism for transmitting the output of the transfer unit 850 to rear wheels are arranged and joined successively in that order to construct a transmission case 807. An oil pan, not shown, is attached to a lower portion of the transmission case 807. The transverse engine 810 has a crankshaft 811 connected to the torque converter 820 contained in the torque converter case 801. An output shaft 821 associated with the torque converter 820 is coupled with a primary shaft 831 included in the belt-drive variable-speed transmission 830 contained in the variable-speed transmission case 802 to transmit power from the crankshaft 811 through the torque converter 820 to the primary shaft 831 of the variable-speed transmission 830. The variable-speed transmission 830 converts an input rotating speed to an output rotating speed of a secondary shaft 832. Power is transmitted from the secondary shaft 832 through a countershaft assembly 839 to the transfer unit 850. The transfer unit 850 transfers power through the front differential gear 840 to front wheels and through a propeller shaft 8116 and a rear differential gear 8117 to rear wheels. An oil pump 808 which is driven continuously by an oil pump drive shaft 824a included in the torque converter 820 is contained in the transmission case 807. The oil pump 788 discharges oil at a line pressure continuously to supply the oil to the torque converter 820 and associated parts, enables the hydraulic control of the variable-speed transmission 830, and enables the hydraulic control of the transfer unit 850 by a hydraulic controller 809 on the basis of signals provided by a traveling speed sensor 809a, a throttle opening sensor 809b, a shift switch 809c, a front wheel speed sensor 809d, a rear wheel speed sensor 809e and a steering angle sensor 809f. The torque converter 820, the belt-type variable-speed transmission 830, the front differential gear 840 and the transfer unit 850 will be successively described with reference to FIGS. 67 and 68. As shown in FIG. 67, the torque converter 820 has the output shaft 821 supported for rotation in ball bearings 821a on the variable-speed transmission housing 802 and the side cover 803 coaxially with the crankshaft 811. The output shaft 821 is surrounded so as to be rotatable by a stator shaft 822 having a substantially cylindrical outer circumference, and provided at its base end with a flange bolted to the variable-speed transmission case 801 through an oil pump housing 808c. The oil pump drive shaft 824a joined to an impeller 824 is fitted rotatably on the stator shaft 822. The outer circumference of the impeller 824 is joined to the outer circumference of a front cover 825 and connected by a drive plate 826 to the crankshaft 811 so as to rotate together with the crankshaft 811. A turbine 827 is disposed opposite to the impeller 824 and is coupled with the output shaft 821 by splines. A stator 828 is interposed between the impeller 824 and the turbine 827 and is supported on a one-way clutch 828a mounted on the stator shaft 822. A lock-up clutch 829 is interposed between the turbine 827 and the front cover 825. The oil pump 808 comprising an inner gear 808a driven for rotation by the oil pump drive shaft 824a, an outer gear 808b engaged with the inner gear 808a, and an oil pump housing 808c is mounted on the base end of the stator shaft 822. The rotation of the crankshaft 811 of the engine 810 is transmitted through the drive plate 826 connected to the crankshaft 811, and the front cover 825 to the impeller 824 to drive the same for rotation. As the impeller 824 rotates, the oil is discharged outside from the impeller 824 by centrifugal force, the oil flows into the turbine 827 to transmit a torque acting in the same direction as the rotating direction of the impeller 824 to the turbine 827, so that the output shaft 821 coupled by the splines with the turbine 827 is driven for rotation. The direction of flow of the oil flowing out from the turbine 827 is deflected by the stator 828 in a direction to assist the rotation of the impeller 824 to increase the torque of the impeller 824. If the turbine 827 rotates at a high rotating speed, the oil flows against the back surface of the stator 828 to make the stator 828 rotate freely on the one-way clutch 828a. When a fixed traveling speed or rotating speed is achieved, the lock-up clutch 829 engages the impeller 824 and the turbine 827 through the front cover 825 to make the torque converter operate without slipping; consequently, the operating speed of the engine 810 is reduced accordingly, whereby fuel consumption is reduced and silence is improved. The belt-drive variable-speed transmission 830 has a primary shaft 831, a secondary shaft 832 disposed in parallel to the primary shaft 831, a primary pulley 833 mounted on the primary shaft 831, a secondary pulley 834 mounted on the secondary shaft 832, and a drive belt 835 extended between the primary pulley 833 and the secondary pulley 834. The respective widths of the grooves of the primary pulley 833 and the secondary pulley 834 are varied to vary the ratio between the pitch diameters of the primary pulley 833 and the secondary pulley 834 for continuously variable speed change. The primary pulley 833 mounted on the primary shaft 831 formed integrally with the output shaft 821 has a fixed cone 833a formed integrally with the primary shaft 831 and a movable cone 833b axially movable relative to the fixed cone 833a. The fixed cone 833a and the movable cone 833b must hold the drive belt 835 by a predetermined clamping force and the width of the groove defined by the fixed cone 833a and the movable cone 833b must be smoothly controllable to ensure the smooth operation of the transmission for continuously variable speed change. Therefore, a plurality of axial grooves are formed in the mating surfaces of the primary shaft 831 and the movable cone 833b, and balls 833c are placed in the mating grooves for torque transmission. A substantially cylindrical piston 837a is fixed to the back surface of the movable cone 833b, i.e., a surface not facing the fixed cone 833a, a pressure chamber 837A is formed by the first piston 837a and a cylinder 837b having the shape of a bottomed cylinder and having a central portion fixed to the primary shaft 831. The movable cone 833b is biased by a spring 837c included in a hydraulic actuator 837 toward the fixed cone 833a. An oil passage 831b is formed in the primary shaft 831 so as to be connected to the pressure chamber 837A. The hydraulic controller 809 executes a control operation on the basis of signals representing the opening of the throttle and such to supply the oil into and to discharge the same from the pressure chamber 837A of the hydraulic actuator 837 through an oil passage 803a formed in the side cover 803 to move the movable cone 833b along the primary shaft 831 to vary the width of the groove of the pulley. The secondary shaft 832 extended in parallel to the primary shaft 831 is supported for rotation in a roller bearing 832a and a ball bearing 832b on the variable-speed transmission housing 802 and the side cover 803. The secondary pulley 834 mounted on the secondary shaft 832 has a fixed cone 834a formed integrally with the secondary shaft 832, and a movable cone 834b axially movable relative to the fixed cone 834a. A plurality of axial grooves are formed in the mating surfaces of the movable cone 834b and the secondary shaft 832, and balls 834c are placed in the mating axial grooves for torque transmission from the secondary pulley 834 to the secondary shaft 832. A substantially cylindrical cylinder 836a is fixed to the back surface of the movable cone 834b, a pressure chamber 836A is defined by the cylinder 836a and a cylindrical piston 836b having a central portion fixed to the secondary shaft 832, and the movable cone 834b is biased toward the fixed cone 834a by a spring 836c included in a hydraulic actuator 836. An oil passage 832b is formed in the secondary shaft 832 so as to be connected to the pressure chamber 836A. The hydraulic controller 809 executes a control operation on the basis of signals representing the opening of the throttle and such to supply the oil into and to discharge the same from the pressure chamber 836A of the hydraulic actuator 836 through an oil passage 801a formed in the torque converter case 801. A drive gear 838 is mounted on one end of the secondary shaft 832. The pressure receiving area of the movable cone 833b of the primary pulley 833 is greater than that of the movable cone 834b of the secondary pulley 834. Therefore, when the oil is supplied into and discharged from the pressure chambers 837A and 836A, the mode of variation of the width of the groove of the primary pulley 833 and that of the width of the groove of the secondary pulley 834 are reverse to each other. Thus, the ratio between the pitch diameters of the primary pulley 833 and the secondary pulley 834 is varied continuously to vary the output rotating speed of the secondary shaft 832 continuously. The rotation of the secondary shaft 832 is transmitted through the drive gear 838 to the countershaft assembly 839 at a reduced rotating speed. The rotation of the countershaft assembly 839 is transmitted through a driven gear 854 and a power transmission shaft 853 to which the driven gear 854 is bolted to the transfer unit 850. The countershaft assembly 839 comprises a shaft 839a supported at its opposite ends in a needle bearing 839e and a roller bearing 839f on the variable-speed transmission housing 802 and the torque converter case 801, respectively, a driven gear 839c of a relatively large diameter fixedly mounted on the shaft 839a for rotation together with the shaft 839a and engaged with the drive gear 838, and a drive gear 839d formed integrally with the driven gear 839c and engaged with the driven gear 854. The respective constructions of the front differential gear 840 and the transfer unit 850 will be described hereinafter with reference to FIG. 67 and FIG. 68 showing an essential portion of a construction shown in FIG. 67 in an enlarged view. The front differential gear 840 is contained in a differential gear housing 841 formed between a driven gear 854 having a cylindrical boss 854a supported in a ball bearing 854b on the variable-speed transmission housing 802, and a substantially cylindrical transmission shaft 853 supported for rotation in a ball bearing 853a on the torque converter case 801. The front differential gear 840 has a hollow, differential gear case 842 rotatably fitted in an expanded part formed of the substantially cylindrical boss 854a of the driven gear 854 formed integrally with a front drive shaft 851, and the transmission shaft 853. A pair of pinions 843b are disposed in the differential gear case 842 and supported on a pinion shaft 843a supported at opposite ends thereof on the differential gear case 842. A left side gear 843c and a right side gear 843d are engaged with the pair of pinions 843b to constitute a differential gear 843. A drive shaft 844 connected to the side gear 843c extends through the differential gear case 842 and the variable-speed transmission housing 802, and transmits power through a constant-velocity joint and an axle to one of the front wheels. A drive shaft 845 connected to the other side gear 843d extends through the differential gear case 842 and the front drive shaft 851 formed integrally with the differential gear case 842, projects from the end cover 805 and transmits power through a constant-velocity joint and an axle to the other front wheel. The transfer unit 850 has the front drive shaft 851, i.e., a first drive shaft, parallel to the crankshaft 811 of the engine 810, the output shaft 821, the primary shaft 831 and the secondary shaft 832, and a rear drive shaft 852, i.e., a second drive shaft. The arrangement of the crankshaft 811, the primary shaft 831, the secondary shaft 832, the front drive shaft 851 and the rear drive shaft 852 extended in parallel to each other is entirely the same as that of the corresponding shafts of the automobile driving system in the seventh embodiment. Thus, the driving system is formed in a compact construction having a relatively small longitudinal dimension to facilitate the installation of the driving system in the engine room and to improve the compatibility of the driving system with both a vehicle body designed to be mounted with a manual transmission (MT) and a vehicle body designed to be mounted with an automatic transmission (AT). The front drive shaft 851 formed integrally with the differential gear case 842 has one end rotatably supported through the transmission shaft 853 and the ball bearing 853a supporting the transmission shaft 853 on the torque converter case 801, and the other end rotatably supported in a needle bearing 851c on the end cover 805. The front drive shaft 851 is provided in the outer circumference of a rear end portion thereof with splines 851b which engage with disk 883 supporting a clutch hub 886 included in a third multiple-disk clutch 884, i.e., a third friction coupling element, and a clutch hub 895 included in a fourth multiple-disk clutch 893, i.e., a fourth friction coupling element. The front drive shaft 851 is inserted in a substantially cylindrical fixed shaft 862 formed integrally with the torque converter case 801. A space between the inner circumference of the fixed shaft 862 and the front drive shaft 851 is closed by a clutch drum 869 included in a first multiple-disk clutch 868, i.e., a first friction coupling element, to form a pressure chamber 862A. The fixed shaft 862 is provided with an oil passage 862a connected to the pressure chamber 862A, and an oil passage 862b formed in its outer circumference. A hub 861 is rotatably mounted on the front drive shaft 851. The hub 851 has a tubular portion 861a fitted on the front drive shaft 851, and a flange 861b formed at the base end of the tubular portion 861a. Splines 861c with which a sun gear 856 included in a double-pinion planetary gear 855 is engaged is formed in a section of the tubular portion 861a near the flange 861b, and splines 861d with which a clutch drum 894 included in a fourth multiple-disk clutch 893, i.e., a fourth friction coupling element, is engaged is formed in an end section of the tubular portion 861a. A clutch hub 879 included in a second multiple-disk clutch 878, i.e., a second friction coupling element, is formed integrally with the flange 861b. The hub 861 is restrained from axial movement by a thrust bearing 861 supported on the fixed shaft 862, a thrust bearing 861g supported on the clutch drum 869, and a thrust bearing 861h supported on the extension case 5 through the disk 883 supporting the clutch hub 886 of the third multiple-disk clutch 884 and the clutch hub 895 of the fourth multiple-disk clutch 893. The double-pinion planetary gear 855 has the sun gear 856 engaged with the splines 861c of the hub 861, a ring gear 857, a first pinion 858 engaged with the sun gear 856, a second pinion 859 engaged with the ring gear 857 and the first pinion 858, and a carrier 860 supporting the first pinion 858 and the second pinion 859 for rotation thereon in needle bearings 860a. Power applied to the ring gear 857 is distributed to the sun gear 856 and the carrier 860 at a torque distribution ratio dependent on the dimensions of the sun gear 856 and the ring gear 857. When the ring gear 857 is fastened to the case 804, the sun gear 856 rotates the carrier 860 in a direction opposite the rotating direction of the sun gear 856. A transfer driven gear 852a is mounted on one end of the rear drive shaft 852 disposed in parallel to the front drive shaft 851, and a bevel gear 852b, which engages with a bevel gear 8113a mounted on one end of an output shaft 8113, is mounted on the other end of the rear drive shaft 852. The rear drive shaft 852 is supported for rotation in a plurality of ball bearings 852c on the torque converter case 801 and the end cover 805 of the transmission case 807. An input selecting means 867 for selectively transmitting power from the transmission shaft 853 to the ring gear 857 or the sun gear 856 is interposed between the transmission shaft 853 and the double-pinion planetary gear 855. The input selecting means 867 comprises the first multiple-disk clutch 868 and the second multiple-disk clutch 878, i.e., a second friction coupling element. In the first multiple-disk clutch 868, a clutch drum 869 supported for rotation on the fixed shaft 862 is engaged with splines 853b formed in one end portion of the transmission shaft 853, and a clutch hub 870 is connected to the ring gear 857 of the double-pinion planetary gear 855. The first multiple-disk clutch 868 interlocks the transmission shaft 853 and the ring gear 857 for power transmission. A pressure is applied to a pressure chamber 871 to compress a retaining plate 873c contiguous with a snap ring 873d, driven plates 873b and drive plates 873a by a piston 872 to engage the first multiple-disk clutch 868 for power transmission. A retainer 875a is disposed on one side of the piston 872 opposite the other side of the same on which the pressure chamber 871 is formed, and a pressure is exerted through a piston 874 on the piston 872 by a return spring 876. In the second multiple-disk clutch 878, the clutch drum 869 of the first multiple-disk clutch 868 serves also as the clutch drum of the second multiple-disk clutch 878, and the clutch hub 879 is formed integrally with the hub 861. The second multiple-disk clutch 878 interlocks the transmission shaft 853 and the sun gear 856 for power transmission. A pressure is applied to a pressure chamber 800 to compress a retaining plate 881c contiguous with a snap ring 881d fixed to the piston 872, driven plates 881b and drive plates 881a coupled with the clutch hub 879 by the piston 772 to engage the second multiple-disk clutch 878 for power transmission. A pressure is exerted on the piston 874 by the return spring 876. The transfer drive gear 882 is supported for rotation by a ball bearing 882a on the case 804 of the transmission case 807 and by a needle bearing 882b on the hub 861 on one side of the double-pinion planetary gear 855 opposite the other side of the same on which the input selecting means 867 is disposed. The transfer driven gear 852a mounted on the rear drive shaft 852 is engaged with the transfer drive gear 882 for power transmission. The carrier 860 of the double-pinion planetary gear 855 and the transfer drive gear 882 are coupled by splines. The third multiple-disk clutch 884 has a clutch drum 885 coupled with the transfer drive gear 882 by a drum connecting member 885a and supported for rotation coaxially with the front drive shaft 851 on the end cover 805, and a clutch hub 886 connected to the disk 883 coupled with the front drive shaft 851 by the splines 851b. The third multiple-disk clutch 884 interlocks the transfer drive gear 882 and the front drive shaft 851 for power transmission. A pressure is applied to a pressure chamber 887 to compress a retaining plate 889c contiguous with a snap ring 889d fixed to the clutch drum 885, driven plates 889b and drive plates 889a coupled with the clutch hub 886 by a piston 888 to engage the third multiple-disk clutch 884 for power transmission. A pressure is exerted on the piston 888 by a return spring 892. The fourth multiple-disk clutch 893, i.e., a fourth coupling element for selectively interlocking the front drive shaft 851 and the hub 861 for power transmission, is interposed between the front drive shaft 851 and the hub 861. The fourth multiple-disk clutch 893 has the clutch drum 894 coupled with the hub 861 by the splines 851b formed on the hub 861, and the clutch hub 895 connected to the disk 883 coupled with the front drive shaft 851 by the splines for power transmission. A pressure is applied to a pressure chamber 896 to compress a retaining plate 898c contiguous with a snap ring 898d fixed to the clutch drum 894, driven plates 898b and drive plates 898a coupled with the clutch hub 895 by a piston 897 to engage the fourth multiple-disk clutch 893 for power transmission. Pressure is exerted on the piston 897 by a return spring 8101. A fifth multiple-disk clutch 8102, i.e., a fifth friction coupling element for selectively fastening the ring gear 857 to the case 804 of the transmission case 807, is interposed between the case 804 of the transmission case 807 and the ring gear 857 of the double-pinion planetary gear 855. A pressure is applied to a pressure chamber 8103 to compress a retaining plate 8105c contiguous with a snap ring 8105d fixed to the case 804, driven plates 8105b and drive plates 8105a coupled with the clutch hub 870 connected to the ring gear 857 by a piston 8104 to engage the fifth multiple-disk clutch 8102 to fasten the ring gear 857 to the case 804. A pressure is exerted on the piston 8104 by a return spring 8106. A control valve is disposed in the oil pan joined to a lower portion of the transmission case 707. The control valve is controlled by the hydraulic controller 809 on the basis of signals provided by the traveling speed sensor 809a, the throttle opening sensor 809b, the shift switch 809c, the front wheel speed sensor 809d, the rear wheel speed sensor 809e and the steering angle sensor 809f to supply the oil discharged from the oil pump selectively to the respective pressure chambers 871, 800, 887, 896 and 8103 of the first multiple-disk clutch 868, the second multiple-disk clutch 878, the third multiple-disk clutch 884, the fourth multiple-disk clutch 893 and the fifth multiple-disk clutch 8102, and the variable-speed transmission 830. An output shaft 8113 is supported in a pair of roller bearings 8112 spaced a predetermined distance apart by a spacer 8111 and supported on the extension case 806 by a retainer 8110 in the extension case 806 joined to the rear end of the torque converter case 801. The bevel gear 8113a is mounted on the front end of the output shaft 8113 and is engaged with the bevel gear 852a mounted on the rear drive shaft 852. The rear end of the output shaft 8113 is connected through a universal coupling and a propeller shaft 8116 to the rear differential gear 8117 to transmit power to the rear differential gear 8117. The operation of the automobile driving system for a four-wheel drive vehicle thus constructed will be described with reference to FIGS. 69 to 72, and FIG. 73 tabulating the operating conditions of the first multiple-disk clutch 868, the second multiple-disk clutch 878. third multiple-disk clutch 884, the fourth multiple-disk clutch 893 and the fifth multiple-disk clutch 8102. In the table shown in FIG. 73, blank circles indicate that the corresponding multiple-disk clutches are engaged or operative, and parenthesized blank circles indicate that multiple-disk clutches are engaged or operative if necessary. The power of the engine 810 is transmitted from the crankshaft 811 through the torque converter 820 to the primary shaft 831 of the variable-speed transmission 830. An input speed of the primary shaft 831 is converted continuously into an output speed of the secondary shaft 832 by the action of the primary pulley 833 and the secondary pulley 834 operatively connected by the drive belt 835. The output speed of the secondary shaft 832 is reduced by the action of the drive gear 838, the countershaft assembly 839 and the driven gear 854. and a reduced speed is transmitted through the clutch drum 869 to the first multiple-disk clutch 868 and the second multiple-disk clutch 878. The first multiple-disk clutch 868 and the second multiple-disk clutch 878 are disengaged and power is not transmitted beyond the first multiple-disk clutch 868 and the second multiple-disk clutch 878 when a neutral position N or a parking position P is selected. When a drive range D, i.e., a forward range, is selected, the first multiple-disk clutch 868 and the fourth multiple-disk clutch 893 are engaged to transmit driving power through a drive line indicated by thick lines in FIG. 69. A pressure is applied through the control valve to the pressure chamber 871 to compress the retaining plate 873c contiguous with the snap ring 873d fixed to the inner circumference of the clutch drum 869, the driven plates 873b, and the drive plates 873a by the piston 872 so that the first multiple-disk clutch 868 is engaged. Consequently, power is transmitted from the driven gear 854 through the transmission shaft 853 to the ring gear 857 of the double-pinion planetary gear 855. A pressure is applied also to the pressure chamber 896 to compress the retaining plate 898c, the driven plate 898b and the drive plate 898a of the fourth multiple-disk clutch 893 by the piston 788 to engage the fourth multiple-disk clutch 893. Consequently, the sun gear 856 of the double-pinion planetary gear 855 and the front drive shaft 851 are interlocked for power transmission through the fourth multiple-disk clutch 893. Accordingly, in the double-pinion planetary gear 855 in which the ring gear 857, i.e., input member, and the first pinion 858 are engaged, and the second pinion 859 is engaged with the first pinion 858 and the sun gear 856 as shown in FIG. 70, the sun gear 856 and the carrier 860 are rotated for differential rotation in the same direction as the rotating direction of the ring gear 857, and torque is distributed at a predetermined distribution ratio to the sun gear 856 and the carrier 860. Thus the front drive shaft 851 coupled with the disk 883 by splines and the transfer drive gear 882 operatively coupled with the carrier 860 by splines are rotated in the rotating direction of the ring gear 857 through the hub 861 coupled with the sun gear 856 by splines, the fourth multiple-disk clutch 893 and the disk 883 coupled with the front drive shaft 851 by splines, and the transfer drive gear 852a engaged with the transfer drive gear 882 is rotated to drive the rear drive shaft 852 for rotation in a direction opposite the rotating direction of the ring gear 857. During torque transmission, the double-pinion planetary gear 855 serves as a center differential gear in which the first pinion 858 and the second pinion 859 rotate and revolve round the sun gear 856 to absorb the difference in rotating speed between the sun gear 856 and the carrier 860. The torque distributing function of the double-pinion planetary gear 855 will be described with reference FIG. 70. The relation between torque distribution and the numbers of teeth of the ring gear 857 and the sun gear 856 is expressed by: where Ti is input torque applied to the ring gear 857, TF is the torque of the sun gear 856 to be transmitted through the hub 861 to the front drive shaft 851, TR is the torque of the carrier 860 to be transmitted to the rear drive shaft 852, ZS is the number of teeth of the sun gear 856 and ZR is the number of teeth of the ring gear 857. Accordingly, an optional reference torque distribution ratio TF/TR can be provided by properly determining ZS of the sun gear 856 and ZR of the ring gear 857. which signifies that about 45% and about 55% of the input torque are distributed to the front wheels and the rear wheels, respectively. Thus, a rear-biased reference torque distribution mode, i.e., a torque distribution mode in which a major part of the input torque is distributed to the rear wheels, can be established. A pressure is applied to the pressure chamber 887 of the third multiple-disk clutch 884 to compress the snap ring 889d, the retaining plate 889c, the driven plate 889b and the drive plat 889a by the piston 888 to produce clutch torque Tc. The hydraulic controller 809 controls the control valve to vary the clutch torque Tc. Front wheel speed NF and rear wheel speed NR measured by the front wheel speed sensor 809d and the rear wheel speed sensor 809e are given to the hydraulic controller 809. The rear wheels always starts slipping first if the vehicle is traveling on a slippery road in the rear-biased reference torque distribution mode, i.e., in a mode in which TF<TR. Therefore, slip S is defined by S=NF/NR (S>0). A clutch pressure Pc corresponding to a slip S and a steering angle .PSI. given to the hydraulic controller 809 from the steering angle sensor 809f is retrieved from a map of FIG. 45 stored in the hydraulic controller 809. If the rear wheels are not slipping and S.gtoreq.1, the clutch pressure Pc is relatively low. If the rear wheels are slipping and S<1, the clutch pressure Pc is increased as the slip S decreases, and the clutch pressure Pc is set to Pmax when the slip S is not greater than a predetermined threshold slip S1. The line pressure is adjusted to the clutch pressure Pc for the variable control of the clutch torque Tc of the third multiple-disk clutch 884. Thus, a bypass drive line 8115 is formed by engaging the third multiple-disk clutch 884. The bypass drive line 8115 extends from the front drive shaft 851 through the third multiple-disk clutch 884 and the transfer drive gear 882 to the carrier 860, and through the sun gear 856, the hub 861 and the fourth multiple-disk clutch 893 to the front drive shaft 851. The bypass drive line 8115 exercises a differential function to meet (rear wheel speed NR)>(rotating speed of the ring gear 857)>(front wheel speed NF) in the transfer unit 850 if the rear wheels slip, and the torque transmitted from the transfer drive gear 882 through the third multiple-disk clutch 884 to the front drive shaft 851 is increased by the clutch torque Tc, and the torque transmitted through the transfer driven gear 852a engaged with the transfer drive gear 882 to the rear drive shaft 852 is reduced by the clutch torque Tc distributed to the front wheels. Consequently, Accordingly, the torque is distributed to the front wheels and the rear wheels at a rear-biased torque distribution ratio TF:TR.apprxeq.45:55 when neither the front wheels nor the rear wheels are slipping because the clutch torque Tc=0 if neither the front wheels nor the rear wheels are slipping. When the rear wheels are slipping and the clutch torque Tc is generated, more part of the input torque Ti is distributed to the front wheels through the bypass drive line 8115 if the clutch torque Tc is greater, and the torque distribution ratio TF:TR changes to TF1:TR1 as shown in FIG. 45 so that the torque distributed to the front wheels is increased positively and the torque distributed to the rear wheels is decreased. Consequently, the slip of the rear wheels is decreased and the traction of the vehicle is improved. When the slip S is decreased below the predetermined threshold slip, the pressure of the oil supplied to the third multiple-disk clutch 884 increases, differential limiting torque increases to a maximum, and the sun gear 856 and the carrier 860 are connected directly. Consequently, the differential motion of the transfer unit 850 is locked and a direct four-wheel-drive mode in which the torque is distributed at a torque distribution ratio corresponding to front-rear axle weight distribution ratio is established, whereby the traction of the vehicle is enhanced to a maximum. If the front wheels slip, the differential function of the transfer unit 850 meets a condition: (rear wheel speed NR)<(rotating speed of the ring gear 857)<(front wheel speed NF), a torque is transmitted from the front drive shaft 851 to the transfer drive gear 882 according to the clutch torque Tc, and the torque transmitted from the front drive shaft 851 to the front wheels is reduced by the clutch torque Tc distributed to the rear wheels. Consequently, Accordingly, the torque is distributed to the front wheels and the rear wheels at a rear-biased torque distribution ratio TF:TR.apprxeq.45:55 when neither the front wheels nor the rear wheels are slipping because the clutch torque Tc=0 if neither the front wheels nor the rear wheels are slipping. When the front wheels are slipping and the clutch torque Tc is generated, the input torque Ti is distributed to the rear wheels according to the clutch torque Tc to increase the torque distributed to the rear wheels positively and to reduce the torque distributed to the front wheels, so that the traction of the vehicle is improved. If the slip S is decreased below the predetermined threshold slip, the pressure of the oil supplied to the third multiple-disk clutch 884 increases, differential limiting torque increases to a maximum, and the sun gear 856 and the carrier 860 are connected directly. Consequently, a direct four-wheel-drive mode in which the torque is distributed at a torque distribution ratio corresponding to front-rear axle weight distribution ratio is established, whereby the traction of the vehicle is fully enhanced. Thus, the torques distributed to the front and the rear wheels are controlled in a wide range according to the mode of slip to avoid the reduction of traction. If the vehicle turns during the torque distribution control for suppressing slip, the differential limiting torque of the third multiple-disk clutch 884 is reduced for correction according to the steering angle .PSI.. Consequently, the differential limiting effect of the transfer unit 850 is reduced and the difference in rotating speed can be satisfactorily absorbed, so that tight corner braking is avoided and satisfactory controllability can be secured. When a reverse range R is selected, the first multiple-disk clutch 868 and the fourth multiple-disk clutch 893 are disengaged and the second multiple-disk clutch 878, the third multiple-disk clutch 884 and the fifth multiple-disk clutch 8102 are engaged to transmit power through a drive line indicated by thick lines in FIG. 72. A pressure is applied through the control valve to the pressure chamber 881 to compress the snap ring 881d, the retaining plate 881c, the drive plates 881a and the driven plates 881b by the piston 874 to engage the second multiple-disk clutch 878 to transmit power from the transmission shaft 853 through the hub 861 to the sun gear 856 of the double-pinion planetary gear 855. A pressure is applied to the pressure chamber 8103 to compress the snap ring 8105d, the retaining plate 8105c, the drive plates 8105a and the driven plates 8105b by the piston 8104 to engage the fifth multiple-disk clutch 8102, whereby the ring gear 857 is fastened to the case 804. The snap ring 889d, the retaining plate 889c, the drive plates 889a and the driven plates 889b are compressed by the piston 888 to engage the third multiple-disk clutch 884 by applying a pressure to the pressure chamber 887, so that power is transmitted from the transfer drive gear 882 through the third multiple-disk clutch 884 to the front drive shaft 851. Consequently, as shown in FIG. 72, the first pinion 858 and the second pinion 859 are rotated in the opposite directions, respectively, by the sun gear 856 carrier 856 and revolve along the ring gear 857 to rotate the carrier 860 in a direction opposite the rotating direction of the sun gear 856. Consequently, power is transmitted through the transfer drive gear 882 and the third multiple-disk clutch 884 to the front drive shaft 851 to drive the rear drive shaft 852 for rotation in a direction opposite the rotating direction of the front drive shaft 851. Therefore, the power transmitted to the driven gear 862 is transmitted in a direction opposite a direction in which power is transmitted when the drive range D is selected to the front drive shaft 851 and the rear drive shaft 852 when the ring gear 857 of the double-pinion planetary gear 855 is fastened to the case 804 by the fifth multiple-disk clutch 8102. Thus, the double-pinion planetary gear 855 is capable of a forward/reverse selecting function. In this case, power is transmitted from the sun gear 856 to the front drive shaft 851 and the rear drive shaft 852 at a gear ratio expressed by: which is an appropriate gear ratio for the reverse range R. The input torque Ti applied to the sun gear 856 is transmitted to the front drive shaft 851 according to the clutch torque Tc, and the rest of the input torque Ti is transmitted to the front wheels. Therefore, the traction of the vehicle is improved by reducing the clutch torque Tc so that part of the input torque Ti distributed to the front wheels is increased positively and the torque distributed to the rear wheels is decreased when the rear wheels slip in order that the slip is suppressed and satisfactory traction can be secured. When the front wheels slip, the clutch torque Tc is increased to distribute more part of the input torque Ti to the rear wheels to increase the torque of the rear wheels positively and the torque distributed to the front wheels is reduced to suppress slip and to improve traction. If the slip S is decreased blow the predetermined threshold slip, the pressure of the oil supplied to the third multiple-disk clutch 884 is increased to a maximum and the differential limiting torque Tc is increased to a maximum to connect the front drive shaft 851 and the transfer drive gear 882 directly to establish a direct four-wheel-drive mode in which the torque is distributed at a torque distribution ratio corresponding to front-rear axle weight distribution ratio, whereby the traction of the vehicle is fully enhanced. If the vehicle turns during the torque distribution control for suppressing slip, the differential limiting torque of the third multiple-disk clutch 884 is reduced according to the steering angle .PSI.. Consequently, the difference in rotating speed can be satisfactorily absorbed, so that tight corner braking is avoided and satisfactory controllability can be secured. In the eighth embodiment, the front drive shaft 851 and the rear drive shaft 852 for transmitting power to the front differential gear 840 connected to the output side of the belt-drive variable-speed transmission 830 and the rear differential gear 8117, respectively, are disposed in parallel to the crankshaft 811 of the transverse engine 710, the double-pinion planetary gear 855 is mounted on the front drive shaft 851 with its sun gear 856 coupled with the front drive shaft 851 through the hub 861 and the fourth multiple-disk clutch 893, the first multiple-disk clutch 868 is capable of transmitting the output of the variable-speed transmission 830 to the ring gear 857, the second multiple-disk clutch 878 is capable of transmitting the output of the variable-speed transmission 830 to the hub 861, the third multiple-disk clutch 884 is capable of interlocking the front drive shaft 851 and the transfer drive gear 882 for power transmission, the fifth multiple-disk clutch 8102 is capable of restraining the ring gear 857 from rotation, and the multiple-disk clutches 868, 878, 884, 893 and 8102 are controlled selectively so that the automobile driving system exercises the functions of a center differential gear to distribute torques properly to the front drive shaft 851 and the rear drive shaft 852 and to achieve a differential limiting operation so that the vehicle is able to travel satisfactorily when the drive range D, i.e., the forward range, or the reverse range R is selected and exercises the functions of a forward/reverse selecting mechanism when the drive range D or the reverse range R is selected. Whereas the conventional automobile driving system needs special double-pinion planetary gears respectively for a center differential gear and a forward/reverse selecting mechanism, the automobile driving system in the eighth embodiment according to the present invention needs a single double-pinion planetary gear for both the functions of the center differential gear and those of the forward/reverse selecting mechanism. Therefore, the automobile driving system in the eighth embodiment according to the present invention exercises high performance, has a simple, compact, lightweight construction having a small overall length along the width of the vehicle body, simplifies control operations, and can be manufactured at a low manufacturing cost. Accordingly, the automobile driving system can be installed on a vehicle body with a sufficiently large space secured between the side walls of the engine room and the opposite ends thereof, so that a sufficient crush stroke necessary for protecting the passenger in the case of lateral collision can be secured, and a sufficiently large space is available for work for installing the transmission in and removing the same from the engine room. Furthermore, the degree of freedom of vehicle body design is increased. An electromagnetic clutch or a wet clutch may be employed instead of the torque converter 820. If an electromagnetic clutch or a wet clutch is employed instead of the torque converter 820, the transmission of power to the primary shaft 831 of the belt-drive variable-speed transmission 830 and beyond the belt-drive variable-speed transmission 830 can be intercepted when the neutral position N or the parking position P is selected. It is known from the comparative examination of the automobile driving system 800 in the eighth embodiment for a four-wheel drive vehicle and the automobile driving system 400 in the fourth embodiment for a two-wheel drive vehicle that the torque converter, the belt-drive variable-speed transmission, the front differential gear, the first, the second and the fifth case forming the transmission case containing the torque converter and the belt-drive variable-speed transmission, and the principal components of the transfer unit including the front drive shaft, the double-pinion planetary gear, the fixed shaft, and the first and the second multiple-disk clutch are common to the automobile driving system 800 in the eighth embodiment for a four-wheel drive vehicle and the automobile driving system 400 in the fourth embodiment for a two-wheel drive vehicle. Therefore, the principal portions of the automobile driving system for a four-wheel drive vehicle can be constructed relatively easily at a reduced manufacturing cost by additionally incorporating the power transmitting mechanism for transmitting power to the rear differential gear including the third, the fourth and the fifth clutch, the transfer drive gear and the rear drive shaft into the automobile driving system 400 in the fourth embodiment for a two-wheel drive vehicle, which contributes greatly to the reduction of the manufacturing cost. * * * * *",

The driving force conveyed from an engine is inputted to a first sun gear through a differential case and dividedly transmitted to a second sun gear through first and second pinions composed of helical gears and to a carrier supporting the first and second pinions, respectively. The driving force conveyed to the second sun gear is transmitted to a left drive axle and the driving force conveyed to the carrier is transmitted to a right drive axle. When slipping occurs in the left or right wheels, the first and second pinions rotate around the first and second sun gears. The helix angles of the first and second pinions produce thrust forces which generate a differential limiting torque between the left and right drive axles.

Description BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a vehicular differential limiting mechanism and particularly to a differential limiting mechanism using a compound type planetary gear unit for generating a differential limiting torque which is proportional to an input torque. 2. Prior Arts When a two wheel drive vehicle incorporating a conventional differential travels in such a state that one of left and right drive wheels is on a road surface with a low friction coefficient and the other is on a road surface with a normal friction coefficient, the vehicle may exhibit an unstable behavior because the wheel on the road surface with a low friction coefficient slips and the other wheel on the road surface with a normal friction coefficient loses traction, too. There occurs a similar phenomenon when the vehicle travels on bumpy roads or traverses steep grades. When the vehicle travels on bumpy roads, the vehicle may experience frequently such a state that one of the left and right drive wheels is detached from a road surface and a drive wheel on the opposite side loses traction. Further, when the vehicle traverses a steep grade, a drive wheel in the high position reduces traction and resultantly a drive wheel in the low position also reduces traction. In general, differential limiting apparatuses capable of generating a differential limiting torque proportional to input torque are of much benefit to improve these phenomena and to enhance vehicle maneuverability under adverse road conditions. Miscellaneous types of differential limiting apparatuses have been developed to date and some of them have been put into practical use. Japanese patent application laid-open No. Toku-Kai-Hei 5-280597 discloses a differential limiting apparatus which comprises a first side gear connected to one output shaft, a second side gear connected to the other output shaft, a first pinion having a first gearing section at one end thereof which meshes with the first sun gear and having a second gearing section at the other end thereof, a second pinion having a third gearing section at one end thereof which meshes with the first gearing section and having a fourth gearing section at the other end thereof which meshes with the second gearing section and at the same time with the second side gear, and a housing having a plurality of holes for accommodating and rotatably supporting a pair of the first and second pinions therein, so as to produce a differential limiting torque by friction forces generated in the meshing portions of gears and the sliding portions between the pinions and the housing or between the pinions and the holes. Further, as another example of disclosures, there is a differential limiting apparatus proposed in Japanese patent application laid-open No. Toku-Kai-Hei 4-271926. The differential according to this disclosure includes a pair of side gears (worm gears) whose respective end is connected with drive axle ends respectively, a plurality of pairs of element gears (worm wheels) meshing with side gears and at the same time meshing with each other at respective gearing sections provided at both ends thereof, a housing for accommodating and supporting the element gears, and bearing members such as thrust washers provided between the ends of the element gears and the housing, so as to generate a differential limiting torque proportional to an input torque. However, the differential limiting apparatus according to the former prior art has several problems coming from using a lot of gears constituting that apparatus. That is, a first problem is a deviation of the differential limiting torque which is caused by many places where friction originates. Secondly, there is a problem of backlash in gears. So many gears produce an increase of accumulated backlashes which leads to play in the power transmission system such as a play between left and rear wheels or between a propeller shaft and the left or right wheel, resulting in an adverse effect on vibrations or noises. Especially when a driver repeats depressing and releasing the accelerator pedal or when he suddenly depresses the accelerator pedal from the release condition, strange noises or vibrations tend to occur in the power transmission system of the vehicle. Reducing backlashes of gears is not acceptable from the view point of an increase in manufacturing cost due to high precision machining processes on the housing and gearing components. Further, another problem is a small degree of freedom in setting gear specifications due to the condition of the number of teeth for arranging a plurality of pinions at an even angular increment. Also, a further problem is a limitation in numbers of teeth of pinions due to a necessity for arranging a plurality of pinions at an even angular increment. Small numbers of teeth incur weak strength of gears. On the other hand, in case of the differential limiting apparatus using the combination of worm gears and worm wheels, as described in the latter case of the prior art, a separate lubricating system is needed to be incorporated because lubrication oil to lubricate these worm gear and worm wheels must be a hypoid gear oil containing extreme-pressure additives. The separate lubricating system is disadvantageous in employing an automatic transmission oil (ATF) for both the automatic transmission and the differential, particularly in case where the automatic transmission and the differential are accommodated in a common housing. The case is similar to the differential using a combination of side gears and pinions as described in the former case of the prior art. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a differential limiting apparatus having a simple construction, a small number of components and a compact body. Further, it is another object of the present invention to provide a torque responsive type differential limiting apparatus having less play in the power transmission system and an excellent maneuverability on a slippery road or the like with a proper operation of the accelerator pedal.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION FIGS. 1 through 11 show a first embodiment in which an example of the differential limiting apparatus has been applied to a front-wheel and front-engine (FF) vehicle. Referring now to FIG. 1, numeral 1 denotes an engine mounted at the front side of a vehicle. A crank shaft 1a of the engine 1 is coupled with a torque converter 2 from which an input shaft 2a extends to an automatic transmission 3. Further, a driving force of the automatic transmission 3 is transmitted and inputted to a differential limiting apparatus 7 also acting as a final speed reduction apparatus through a primary reduction drive gear 4, a primary reduction driven gear 5 meshing with the drive gear 4 and a final drive gear 6 connected with the driven gear 5. A driving force is transmitted from the differential limiting apparatus 7 to a left wheel 10 through a left drive shaft 8 and a left axle shaft 9 and to a right wheel 13 through a right drive shaft 11 and a right axle shaft 12, respectively. These components, torque converter 2, automatic transmission 3, gears 4, 5 and 6, and differential limiting apparatus 7 are integrally accommodated in one transmission case 14 and are lubricated with ATF. Describing the differential limiting apparatus 7 with reference to FIGS. 2 and 3, the left drive shaft 8 is rotatably suspended through a left transmission case 14L and the right drive shaft 11 is rotatably suspended through a right transmission case 14R on the same axis of rotation as the right drive shaft 11. Further, the left and right drive shafts are sealed against the left and right transmission cases 14L and 14R by oil seals 15, 15, respectively. A final driven gear 16 meshing with the final drive gear 6 is rotatably coupled about the periphery of the left drive shaft 8 and the left drive shaft 8 and the final driven gear 16 are supported by the left transmission case 14L through a bearing 17. A differential case 18 is fixed at one end thereof to the final driven gear 16 on the same axis of rotation as the final driven gear 16 and the other end of the differential case 18 is rotatably coupled about the periphery of the right drive shaft 11. Further, the right drive shaft 11 and the differential case 18 are rotatably supported by the right transmission case 14R through a bearing 19. Within the differential case 18, a carrier 20 is rotatably provided on the common axis of rotation and the left and right drive axles 8 and 11 are inserted in the carrier 20, respectively. The carrier 20 is connected with the end portion of the right drive shaft 11 through splines. Further, a first sun gear 21 having a large diameter is connected with the differential case 18 through splines and a second sun gear 22 having a small diameter is connected with the end portion of the left drive shaft 8. The first sun gear 21 meshes with a first pinion 23 having a small diameter, forming a first gear train. Further, the second sun gear 22 meshes with a second pinion 24 having a large diameter, forming a second gear train. Further, washers 25 and 26 are inserted between an end face of the first sun gear 21 and the carrier 20 and between an end face of the second sun gear 22 and the final driven gear 16, respectively. The first pinion 23 and the second pinion 24 are integrally formed on a pinion member 27 and a plurality of the pinion members 27 (preferably, at least 3 pieces of the pinion members) are rotatably supported by respective planetary pins 28 which are fixed to the carrier 20. Further, a washer 29 is inserted at both ends of the pinion member 27 respectively for supporting thrust loads acting between the pinion member 27 and the carrier 20. The driving force conveyed from the final drive gear 6 is transmitted to the first sun gear 21 through the final driven gear 16 and the differential case 18. The driving force transmitted to the first sun gear 21 is conveyed to the left drive shaft 8 through the pinion member 27 and the second sun gear 22 and at the same time to the right drive shaft 11 through the carrier 20. The thus constituted compound planetary type differential limiting apparatus 7 can have a differential function by properly selecting numbers of teeth of the first and second sun gears 21, 22 and the first and second pinions 23, 24 which are arranged around those sun gears 21, 22. Further, this differential limiting apparatus can also be designed so that the standard torque distribution between the left and right wheels becomes even (50:50) by properly establishing pitch circle radii of the first and second sun gears 21, 22 and the first and second pinions 23, 24. Incidentally, torque transmitted to gears with inclined teeth generates a thrust force against gear mounting surfaces. In this differential limiting apparatus, both first and second gear trains have teeth with helix angles and further a respective helix angle is different from each other. As a result, some amount of thrust forces are offset and some are reserved. This reserved (remaining) thrust forces generate a friction torque at one end of the pinion member 27. On the other hand, the gear meshes produce separating forces and tangential forces in both pinions 23, 24 and the planetary pin 28 and the resultant force generates another friction torque. These friction torques act as a differential limiting torque, a differential limiting function being provided in the differential limiting apparatus 7. Next, the differential function will be described with reference to FIGS. 4, 5 and 6. Referring to FIG. 5, when the first sun gear 21 is fixed, the following equation is obtained on the circle with a radius r.sub.s2 : Further, in FIG. 6, when the second sun gear 22 is fixed, the following equation is obtained on the circle with a radius rs1: Further, the equations (1) and (2) are expressed respectively in the following equations: were .omega..sub.s1 is a angular velocity of the first sun gear 21, .omega..sub.s2 is an angular velocity of the second sun gear 22, r.sub.s2 is a pitch circle radius of the first sun gear 21, r.sub.s2 is a pitch circle radius of the second sun gear 22, .omega..sub.p1 is a angular velocity of the first pinion 23, .omega..sub.p2 is an angular velocity of the second pinion 24, r.sub.p1 is a pitch circle radius of the first pinion 23, r.sub.p2 is a pitch circle radius of the second pinion 24, and .omega..sub.c is an angular velocity of the carrier 20. Since the first pinion 23 is integral with the second pinion 24, .omega..sub.p1 is equal to .omega..sub.p2, therefore the equations (3) and (4) can be rewritten as follows: Further, substituting rotational speed for angular velocity and number of teeth for pitch circle radius, the equation (5) can be expressed as follows: where the angular speed .omega..sub.s1 of the first sun gear 21 is replaced with an input rotational speed N.sub.i, the angular speed .omega..sub.c of the carrier 20 is replaced with a rotational speed N.sub.R of the front right wheel, the angular speed .omega..sub.s2 of the second sun gear 22 is replaced with a rotational speed N.sub.L of the front left wheel, the pitch circle radius r.sub.s1 of the first sun gear 21 is replaced with a number of teeth Z.sub.s1, the pitch circle radius r.sub.s2 of the second sun gear 22 is replaced with a number of teeth Z.sub.s2, the pitch circle radius r.sub.p1 of the first pinion 23 is replaced with a number of teeth Z.sub.p1, and the pitch circle radius r.sub.p2 of the second pinion 24 is replaced with a number of teeth Z.sub.p2. Further, letting Z.sub.p1 =24, Z.sub.p2 =24, Z.sub.s1 =30 and Z.sub.s2 =15, the equation (5)' is: When N.sub.i.noteq. 0, an inequality N.sub.L >N.sub.i >N.sub.R or N.sub.R >N.sub.i >N.sub.L is formed between N.sub.L, N.sub.R and N.sub.i. It is understood from this that the front right wheel rotational speed N.sub.R has the same rotational direction as the front left wheel rotational speed N.sub.L, thus the differentiation has been accomplished. Next, a function of even torque distribution will be described with reference to FIGS. 7, 8, 9 and 10. The following equations are formed: where T.sub.i is an input torque of the first sun gear 21, T.sub.R is a front right side torque of the carrier 20, T.sub.L is a front left side torque of the second sun gear 22, r.sub.s1 is an intermeshing pitch circle radius of the first sun gear 21, r.sub.p1 is an intermeshing pitch circle radius of the first pinion 23, r.sub.s2 is an intermeshing pitch circle radius of the second sun gear 22, and r.sub.p2 is an intermeshing pitch circle radius of the second pinion 24. Further, since a tangential load P acting at the meshing point between the first sun gear 21 and the pinion 23 is equal to a sum of a tangential load P.sub.1 acting on the carrier 20 and a tangential load P.sub.2 acting at the meshing point between the second sun gear 22 and the second pinion 24 and since P=T.sub.i /r.sub.s1, P.sub.1 =T.sub.R /(r.sub.s1 +r.sub.p1) and P.sub.2 =T.sub.L /r.sub.s2, the following equation is obtained: Substituting the equations (6) and (7) into the equation (8), Thus, it is understood that the torque distribution between the front right side torque T.sub.R and the front left side torque T.sub.L can be varied arbitrarily by changing the intermeshing pitch circle radii of the first and second sun gears 21, 22 and the first and second pinions 23, 24,respectively. Here, replacing the intermeshing pitch circle radii r.sub.s1, r.sub.s1, r.sub.p1 and r.sub.p2 with the numbers of teeth Z.sub.s1, Z.sub.s2, Z.sub.p1 and Z.sub.p2 and substituting the aforementioned numbers (Z.sub.p1 =24, Z.sub.p2 =24, Z.sub.s1 =30 and Z.sub.s2 =15) into these numbers of teeth, T.sub.R =0.5 T.sub.i and T.sub.L =0.5 T.sub.i are obtained. Therefore, the torque distribution ratio between left and right wheels becomes around 50:50 by which torque is equally distributed. Describing the function of differential limiting according to the first embodiment in more detail, the first gear train composed of the first sun gear 21 and the first pinion 23 has respective teeth with a specified helix angle and further the second gear train composed of the second sun gear 22 and the second pinion 24 has respective teeth with a different specified helix angle than the first gear train. Therefore, the thrust loads acting at the meshing points between the first sun gear 21 and the first pinion 23 act in the direction of the planetary pin 28 without being canceled by the thrust loads acting at the meshing points between the second sun gear 22 and the second pinion 24. As a result, a sliding friction force is generated at the end surface of the washer 29. Further, a rotational friction force generates at the planetary pin 28 due to the resultant force of the separating loads and the tangential loads acting at the meshing points of these gears. The sum of these friction forces acts as a friction torque proportional to the input torque in the opposite direction to the rotational direction of the pinion. This friction torque is a differential limiting torque. The rotating direction of the pinion varies according to a larger one between the front right wheel rotation number N.sub.R and the front left wheel rotation number N.sub.L and therefore the differential limiting torque applied also varies. As a result of this, the driving force distribution between left and right wheels changes automatically in accordance with the difference of the differential limiting torque when the right wheel slips (N.sub.R >N.sub.L) or when the left wheel slips (N.sub.R <N.sub.L). First, the case of N.sub.R >N.sub.L will be described with reference to FIGS. 7, 8 and 9. Under this condition, when the input torque T.sub.i is inputted to the first sun gear 21 in the counterclockwise direction as shown in FIG. 9, the first and second pinions 23, 24 rotate on the pinion shaft in the same direction and the second sun gear 22 and the carrier 20 also rotate in the same counterclockwise direction. Consequently, the friction torque T.sub.f of the pinion side acts in the clockwise direction opposite to the pinion. The tangential load P, the separating load F.sub.s1 and the thrust load F.sub.t1 acting on the tooth surfaces of the first sun gear 21 and the first pinion 23 are expressed respectively as follows: where .alpha..sub.1 is a pressure angle of the first pinion 23 and .beta..sub.1 is a helix angle thereof. Therefore, the resultant force N.sub.p1 acting on the planetary pin 28 is calculated as follows: ##EQU1## Similarly, the separating load F.sub.s2 and the thrust load F.sub.t2 acting between the second sun gear 22 and the second pinion 24 are expressed as follows: where P.sub.2 is a tangential load acting between the second sun gear 22 and the second pinion 24, .alpha..sub.2 is a pressure angle of the second pinion 24 and .beta..sub.2 is a helix angle thereof. Therefore, the resultant force N.sub.p2 acting on the pinion shaft 58 is calculated as follows: ##EQU2## Further, the remaining thrust load .DELTA.F.sub.t which is generated in the first and second pinions 22 and 24 is as follows: ##EQU3## The friction torque T.sub.f is a sum of the friction force by the resultant force of N.sub.p1 and N.sub.p2 and the friction force by the remaining thrust force .DELTA.F.sub.t and it is expressed as follows: ##EQU4## where .mu..sub.1 is a friction coefficient between the pinion member 27 and the planetary pin 28, re is a radius of the inner diameter of the pinion, .mu..sub.2 is a sliding friction coefficient at the washer 29, rd is a radius of the outer diameter of the washer 29, and n is a number of contact surfaces. The following equation is obtained from the torque balance of the first and second pinions 23 and 24: Further, the equation (10) is rewritten by adding friction torque T.sub.f as follows: Here, replacing the intermeshing pitch circle radiuses r.sub.s1, r.sub.s2, r.sub.p1 and r.sub.p2 with the number of teeth of each gear Z.sub.s1, Z.sub.s2, Z.sub.p1 and Z.sub.p2 and further substituting the aforementioned numbers of teeth (Z.sub.p1 =24, Z.sub.p2 =24, Z.sub.s1 =30 and Z.sub.s2 =15) into these numbers of teeth, the above formula (16) can be written as follows: Since T.sub.i =T.sub.R +T.sub.L, substituting this into the formula (16), the following formula is obtained: Further, replacing these pitch circle radii r.sub.s1, r.sub.s2, r.sub.p1 and r.sub.p2 with the number of teeth of each gear Z.sub.s1, Z.sub.s2, Z.sub.p1 and Z.sub.p2, the formula (18) is expressed as follows: Here, if .mu..sub.1 =0 and .mu..sub.2 =0, T.sub.f =0. The value of left and right wheel torques T.sub.L and T.sub.R show the same distribution of torque as the aforementioned case of even torque distributing function. It is understood that the differential limiting torque T.sub.f .multidot.r.sub.s2 /r.sub.p2 which is proportional to the friction torque T.sub.f is generated and that the magnitude of distributed torque to the front left wheel is increased by the amount of differential limiting torque and the magnitude of distributed torque to the front right wheel is decreased by as much. Further, it is understood that the differential limiting torque is proportional to the input torque because the resultant forces N.sub.p1, N.sub.p2 and the remaining thrust force .DELTA.F.sub.t are proportional to the input torque, respectively. On the other hand, the remaining thrust force .DELTA.F.sub.t can be changed by adjusting the helix angles .beta..sub.1, .beta..sub.2 of the first and second pinions 23, 24 respectively. Further, it is possible to change the friction coefficient .mu..sub.1 by altering the type of the bearing (for example, needle bearing, bushing or the like) between the pinion member 27 and the planetary pin 28. Thus, the magnitude of the differential limiting torque can be established to be various values together with the friction torque T.sub.f. Next, the case of N.sub.L >N.sub.R will be described with reference to FIG. 10. Under this condition, the first and second pinions 23, 24 revolve around the first sun gear 21 and the second sun gear 22 respectively while rotating on the planetary pin 28 in the clockwise direction and the friction torque T.sub.f acts in the unticlockwise direction. Therefore, the torque balance within the first and second pinions 23, 24 is expressed in the following equation: Undertaking the same calculation as before, the front left wheel torque T.sub.L and the front right wheel torque T.sub.R are calculated as follows : Thus, also under this condition, it is understood that the same differential limiting torque, T.sub.f .multidot.r.sub.s2 /r.sub.p2 is generated. Further, it is understood that, inversely to the case of N.sub.R >N.sub.L, the magnitude of the front left wheel torque T.sub.L is decreased by the amount of the differential limiting torque and the magnitude of the front right wheel torque T.sub.R is increased by as much. An operation of the differential limiting apparatus thus constituted will be described using a torque characteristic diagram shown in FIG. 11. First, a driving force transmitted from the engine 1 is inputted to the automatic transmission 3 through the torque converter 2 and the input shaft 2a and the driving force converted by the automatic transmission 3 is inputted to the differential limiting apparatus 7 through the primary reduction drive gear 4, the primary reduction driven gear 5 and the final drive gear 6. Further, the driving force is transferred to the final driven gear 16 and the differential case 18 in this order and inputted to the first sun gear 21. Further, the driving force is divided into two ways, one being distributed to the second sun gear 22 through the first and second pinions 23, 24 and another being distributed to the carrier 20 supporting the first and second pinions 23, 24. The driving force distributed to the sun gear 22 is transmitted to the front left wheel 10 through the left drive shaft 8 and the left axle shaft 9. On the other hand, the driving force distributed to the carrier 20 is transmitted to the front right wheel 13 through the right drive shaft 11 and the right axle shaft 12. When the vehicle travels in a straight line, since N.sub.L =N.sub.R, the second sun gear 22 rotates in the same direction and at the same speed as the carrier 20 does while the first and second pinions 23, 24 stop rotation around the planetary pin 28. Because of the inoperative first and second pinions 23, 24, there arises no friction torque between the pinions and the carrier. The front left and right wheel torques T.sub.L and T.sub.R are established respectively to be a standard torque distribution ratio which is determined by gear specifications, in this embodiment to be equal (50:50) as shown by a straight line L.sub.0 in FIG. 11. When the front right wheel slips, since N.sub.R >N.sub.L, the first and second pinions 23, 24 make a planetary rotation to produce differentiation based on the gear specifications. Therefore, when the vehicle turns, the difference between left and right wheels in rotation number is absorbed so as to enable a smooth turn. Further, the planetary rotation of the first and second pinions 23, 24 is accompanied by a thrust load produced from the difference in the helix angles thereof. The thrust load acts on the washer 29 at either end of the pinions 23, 24. Further, the resultant force of the separating and tangential forces at the meshing portions of the gears acts on the first and second pinions 23, 24 and the planetary pin 28, respectively. Both of the thrust load and resultant force generate a friction torque in the opposite direction to the rotational direction of the pinions and this friction torque acts as a differential limiting torque. Under this condition, since the differential limiting torque acts so as to restrict the rotation of the carrier 20, that amount of the differential limiting torque transfers to the front left wheel side and a larger amount of torque than the standard torque distribution ratio is distributed to the front left wheel as shown by a straight line L.sub.L in FIG. 11, thereby the front right wheel being prevented from slipping when the vehicle going straight. When the front left wheel slips, since N.sub.L >N.sub.R, similarly, the difference between the first and second pinions 23, 24 in rotation number produces a planetary rotation, thereby a friction torque is generated. Under this condition, since the differential limiting torque acts so as to encourage the rotation of the carrier 20, that amount of the differential limiting torque transfers to the front right wheel side and a larger amount of torque than the standard torque distribution ratio is distributed to the front right wheel as shown by a straight line L.sub.R in FIG. 11, thereby the front left wheel being prevented from slipping. Because the differential limiting torque generates in proportional to the input torque, the distribution ratio between left and right wheels is always constant, therefore the differential limiting ability is always displayed at a constant rate. Thus, the differential limiting apparatus according to the first embodiment of the present invention provides a greater number of advantages over the prior art such as a simple construction, small number of components, a compact and light weight body, a good workability, an easy assembly, an excellent vibration/noise characteristic, a good response, an improved maneuverability, and the like. FIG. 12 and FIG. 13 show a second embodiment of the present invention. The second embodiment presents a differential limiting apparatus applied to a front engine rear drive (FR) vehicle. Referring to FIG. 12, the driving force from the engine 1 is inputted to a differential limiting apparatus 34 for rear wheels through a transmission 31, a propeller shaft 32 and a drive pinion 33. Further, the driving force is transmitted from the differential limiting apparatus 34 to a rear left wheel 36 through a left axle shaft 35 and to a rear right wheel 38 through a right axle shaft 37, respectively. As shown in FIG. 13, the drive pinion 33 and the differential limiting apparatus 34 are accommodated in a rear differential carrier 39. Further, the rear differential carrier 39 is covered at the rear end thereof with a rear cover 40. The drive pinion 33 is rotatably supported at its shaft portion 33 which is connected with the propeller shaft 32 by bearings 41, 41. The left axle shaft 35 is rotatably fit through a hole provided in a left side retainer 42L connected to the rear differential carrier 39 and, on the same axis as the left axle shaft 35, the right axle shaft 37 is rotatably fit through a hole provided in a right side retainer 42R connected to the rear differential carrier 39. Respective holes are sealed by an oil seal 43, 43. Further, the outer periphery of the left axle shaft 35 is rotatably fit to a left differential case 44L which is supported through a bearing 45 by the left side retainer 42L. The left differential case 44L is connected with one end of an right differential case 44R. A crown gear 46 is mounted at the connecting portion of the left differential case 44L and the right differential case 44R on the same axis of rotation as the left and right differential cases 44L, 44R. The outer periphery of the right axle shaft 37 is rotatably fit to the other end of the right differential case 44R. Further, the right differential case 44R is rotatably supported through the bearing 45 by the right side retainer 42R. That is, the differential case 44 comprising the left and right differential cases 44L, 44R and the crown gear 46 is rotatably supported within the rear differential carrier 39. A carrier 47 is provided in the differential case 44 rotatably about the same axis as the differential case 44. The left and right axle shafts 35, 37 are inserted into the carrier 47 and the right axle shaft 37 is connected with the carrier 47 through splines provided at the left end thereof. The right differential case 44R is connected inside thereof with a first sun gear 48 having a large diameter through splines and on the other hand the left axle shaft 35 is connected at the right end thereof with a second sun gear 49 having a small diameter. The first sun gear 48 meshes with a first pinion 50 having a small diameter, forming a first gear train and the second sun gear 49 meshes with a second pinion 51 having a large diameter, forming a second gear train. Further, there are provided washers 52 and 53 between the first sun gear 48 and the carrier 47 and between the second sun gear 49 and the left differential case 44L, respectively. The first and second pinions 50, 51 are formed integrally with a pinion member 54. In this embodiment, three pinion members 54, 54 and 54 are rotatably mounted on respective planetary pins 55 fixed to the carrier 47. Further, a washer 56 is provided between both ends of the respective pinion member 54 and the carrier 47 in order to support a thrust load generated from the pinion member 54, respectively. The driving force conveyed from the drive pinion 33 is transmitted to the first sun gear 48 through the crown gear 46 and the differential case 44 and further transmitted to the left axle shaft 35 through the pinion member 54 and the second sun gear 49. On the other hand, the driving force from the first sun gear 48 is transmitted to the right axle shaft 37 through the carrier 47. Thus, a compound planetary gear type differential limiting apparatus is constituted. This compound planetary type differential limiting apparatus acts as a differential by properly selecting the number of teeth of the first and second sun gears 48, 49 and the first and second pinions 50, 51. Also, the apparatus has a function of an even torque distribution of 50:50 by properly establishing the intermeshing pitch circle radii of the first and second sun gears 48, 49 and the first and second pinions 50, 51. Further, in this differential limiting apparatus, both first and second gear trains have teeth with helix angles and further a respective helix angle is different from each other. As a result, some amount of thrust forces are offset and some are reserved. The reserved thrust forces generate a friction torque at one end of the pinion member 54. On the other hand, the gear meshes produce separating forces and tangential forces in the first and second pinions 50, 51 and the planetary pin 55 and the resultant force generates another friction torque. These friction torques act as a differential limiting torque, a differential limiting function being provided in the differential limiting apparatus 34. The differential function, the even torque distribution function and the differential limiting function have been described in the first embodiment. Therefore a detailed description is omitted here. Next, an operation of the differential limiting apparatus according to the second embodiment will be described. First, the driving force of the engine 1 is inputted to the differential limiting apparatus 34 through the transmission 31, the propeller shaft 32, and the drive pinion 33. Then, the driving force is transmitted to the first sun gear 48 through the crown gear 46 and the differential case 44. Further, the driving force is divided into two ways, one transmitted to the second sun gear 49 through the first and second pinions 50, 51 and the other transmitted to the carrier 47 supporting the first and second pinions 50, 51. The driving force conveyed to the second sun gear 49 is further transmitted to the rear left wheel 36 through the left drive axle 35 and the driving force conveyed to the carrier 47 is transmitted to the rear right wheel 38 through the right axle shaft 37. When the rear left wheel rotates at the same rotation speed as the rear right wheel (N.sub.L =N.sub.R), since the second sun gear 49 rotates at the same speed in the same direction as the carrier 47, the first and second pinions 50, 51 stop the planetary rotation and rotate integrally with the carrier 47. This integral rotation of the first and second pinions 50, 51 and the carrier 47 does not produce friction between both, therefore, the torque distribution between the rear left and rear right wheels is established at the standard torque distribution ratio determined according to gear specifications, that is, in this embodiment, around 50:50. When the rear right wheel rotates faster than the rear left wheel (N.sub.R >N.sub.L), i.e., when the rear right wheel causes slipping, then the first and second pinions 50, 51 make a planetary rotation to produce differentiation between the rear left and rear right wheels, this providing the vehicle with a smooth turn. Further, the planetary rotation of the first and second pinions 50, 51 is accompanied by a thrust load produced from the difference in the helix angles thereof. The thrust load acts on the washer 56 at either end of the pinions 50, 51. Further, the resultant force of the separating and tangential forces at the meshing portions of the gears acts on the first and second pinions 50, 51 and the planetary pin 55, respectively. Both of the thrust load and resultant force generate a friction torque in the opposite direction to the rotational direction of the pinions and this friction torque acts as a differential limiting torque. Under this condition, since the differential limiting torque acts so as to restrict the rotation of the carrier 47, that amount of the differential limiting torque transfers to the rear left wheel side and a larger amount of torque than the standard torque distribution ratio is distributed to the rear left wheel, thereby the rear right wheel being prevented from slipping when the vehicle going straight. When the front left wheel slips, since N.sub.L >N.sub.R, similarly, the difference between the first and second pinions 50, 51 in rotation number produces a planetary rotation, whereby a friction torque is generated. Under this condition, since the differential limiting torque acts so as to encourage the rotation of the carrier 47, that amount of the differential limiting torque transfers to the rear right wheel side and a larger amount of torque than the standard torque distribution ratio is distributed to the rear right wheel, thereby the rear left wheel being prevented from slipping. Because the differential limiting torque generates in proportional to the input torque, the distribution ratio between rear left and rear right wheels is always constant, therefore the differential limiting ability is always displayed at a constant rate. Thus, the differential limiting apparatus according to the second embodiment of the present invention provides a vehicle with a greater number of advantages than the one according to the prior art, such as a simple construction, small number of components, a compact and light weight body, easy assembling, an excellent vibration/noise characteristic, a good response, an improved maneuverability and the like. FIG. 14 shows an third embodiment in which a differential limiting apparatus according to the present invention is applied to front and rear axles of a four wheel drive vehicle having a center differential. The driving force of the engine 1 is transmitted to a center differential 62 through an automatic transmission 61 including a torque converter and a transmission output shaft 61a. The driving force from the center differential 62 is divided into two ways, one is transmitted to the rear differential limiting apparatus 34 through a rear drive shaft 63, a propeller shaft 32 and a drive pinion 33 and the other is transmitted to the front differential limiting apparatus 68 through a transfer gear 64, a transfer driven gear 65, a front drive shaft 66 and a drive pinion 67. In this embodiment, the automatic transmission 61, the center differential 62 and the front differential limiting apparatus 68 are accommodated integrally within a case 69 and therefore a common lubrication system using ATF is incorporated. The driving force inputted to the rear differential limiting apparatus 34 is transmitted to a rear left wheel 36 through a left axle shaft 35 and to a rear right wheel 38 through a right axle shaft 37. Further, the driving force inputted to the front differential limiting apparatus 68 is transmitted to a front left wheel 10 through a left axle shaft 70 and also to a front right wheel 13 through a right axle shaft 71. The center differential 62 is incorporated at the rear portion of the case 69. The transmission output shaft 61a is rotatably inserted in the center differential 62 from ahead and the rear drive shaft 63 is rotatably inserted therein frombehind. In the center differential 62, a carrier 72 is rotatably coupled about the transmission shaft 61a. Further, this transmission output shaft 61a is connected at the rear end thereof with a third sun gear 73 having a large diameter. The rear drive shaft 63 is connected at the front end thereof with a fourth sun gear 74 having a small diameter. These third and fourth sun gears 73, 74 are accommodated in the carrier 72. The third sun gear 73 meshes with a third pinion 75 having a small diameter, a third gear train being formed. Further, the fourth sun gear 74 meshes with a fourth pinion 76 having a large diameter, a fourth gear train being formed. The third pinion 75 is formed integrally with the fourth pinion 76 and a plurality of pairs of the pinions, 75, 76 (three pairs in this embodiment) are rotatably supported by respective planetary pins 77 fixed to the carrier 72. The carrier 72 is connected at the front end thereof with the transfer drive gear 64 so as to output the driving force to the front wheels. That is, the driving force from the transmission output shaft 61a is transmitted to the third sun gear 73 and then the driving force is transmitted from the fourth sun gear 74 to the rear drive shaft 63 and at the same time from the carrier 72 to the front drive shaft 66 through the transfer drive gear 64 and the transfer driven gear 65. Thus, a compound planetary type center differential is constituted. This compound planetary type center differential can have a differential function by properly establishing the numbers of teeth of the third and fourth sun gears 73, 74 and a plurality of third and fourth pinions 75, 76 arranged around these sun gears 73, 74. Further, this center differential can have a function of even torque distribution (50:50) or a function of uneven torque distribution between front and rear wheels selectively by means of properly establishing the intermeshing pitch circle radii of the third and fourth sun gears 73, 74 and the third and fourth pinions 75, 76. Further, the center differential according to the present invention can also have a differential limiting function by means of generating a friction torque between the pinions and the planetary pin or between the pinions and the carrier. The friction torque can be obtained by a thrust force generated in the third and fourth gear trains having helical gears and by a resultant force of the separating and tangential loads at the meshing points between the sun gears and the pinions. The front differential limiting apparatus 68 is an apparatus corresponding to the front differential limiting apparatus 7 described in the first embodiment of the present invention. A carrier 79 connected with the left axle shaft 70 is rotatably supported by a differential case 78. In the carrier 79, a first sun gear 80 having a large diameter and a second sun gear 81 are rotatably accommodated, respectively. Further, the first sun gear 80 is connected with the differential case 78 and the second sun gear 81 is connected with the right axle shaft 71. The first sun gear 80 meshes with a first pinion 82 having a small diameter, a first gear train being formed. Further, the second sun gear 81 meshes with a second pinion 83 having a large diameter, a second gear train being formed. The first pinion 82 is formed integrally with the second pinion 83 and a plurality of pairs of the pinions, 82, 83 (three pairs in this embodiment) are rotatably supported by respective planetary pins 84 fixed to the carrier 79. Further, a hypoid drive gear 85 is rigidly mounted around the outer periphery of the differential case 78 and meshes with the drive pinion 67. The driving force from the drive pinion 67 is transmitted to the first sun gear 80 through the hypoid drive gear 85 and the differential case 78. Then, the driving force is outputted from the second sun gear 81 to the right axle shaft 71 and at the same time from the carrier 79 to the left axle shaft 70. Thus, a compound planetary gear type differential limiting apparatus is constituted. This compound planetary type differential limiting apparatus can have a differential function by properly establishing the numbers of teeth of the first and third sun gears 80, 81 and a plurality of first and second pinions 82, 83 arranged around these sun gears 80, 81. Further, this differential limiting apparatus can have a function of even torque distribution (50:50) between left and right wheels by means of properly establishing the intermeshing pitch circle radii of the first and second sun gears 80, 81 and the first and second pinions 82, 83. Further, the differential limiting apparatus according to the present invention can also have a differential limiting function bymeans of generating a friction torque between the pinions and the planetary pin or between the pinions and the carrier. The friction torque can be obtained by a thrust force generated in the first and second gear trains having helical gears and by a resultant force of the separating and tangential loads at the meshing points between the sun gears 80, 81 and the pinions 82, 83. Next, an operation of thus constituted differential limiting apparatus will be described. First, the driving force of the engine 1 is inputted to the third sun gear 73 of the center differential 62 through the automatic transmission 61 and the transmission output shaft 61a. Then, the driving force is divided into two ways, one transmitted from the third and fourth pinions 75, 76 to the fourth sun gear 74 and the other transmitted to the carrier 72 supporting the third and fourth pinions 75, 76. The driving force conveyed to the fourth sun gear 74 is transmitted to the rear wheel side through the rear drive shaft 63 and the driving force conveyed to the carrier 72 is transmitted to the front wheel side through the transfer drive gear 64, the transfer driven gear 65 and the front drive shaft 66. Thus, the vehicle can be driven with four wheels. When the vehicle runs in a straight line, since the front wheel speed N.sub.F is equal to the rear wheel speed N.sub.B (N.sub.F =N.sub.B), in the center differential 62 the fourth sun gear 74 rotates at the same speed in the same direction as the carrier 72 and the third and fourth pinions 75, 76 stop the planetary rotation and rotate integrally with the carrier 72. This integral rotation of the third and fourth pinions 75, 76 together with the carrier 72 does not produce friction torque between both, therefore, the torque distribution between front and rear wheels is established at the standard torque distribution ratio T.sub.F :T.sub.B (T.sub.F is a front wheel torque and T.sub.B is a rear wheel torque) which is determined according to gear specifications, of an even torque distribution ratio of around 50:50 or of an uneven torque distribution ratio. When the vehicle makes a turn or slips at the front wheel, since the front wheel rotates faster than the rear wheel (N.sub.F >N.sub.B), then in the center differential 62 the third and fourth pinions 75, 76 make a planetary rotation to produce differentiation between the front and rear wheels, enabling the vehicle to make a smooth turn due to an absorption of the difference between the front and rear wheels in rotation number. Further, the planetary rotation of the third and fourth pinions 75, 76 is accompanied by a thrust load produced from the difference in the helix angles thereof. The thrust load acts at either end of the third and fourth pinions 75, 76. Further, the resultant force of the separating and tangential forces at the meshing portions of the gears acts on the third and fourth pinions 75, 76 and the planetary pin 77, respectively. Both of the thrust load and resultant force generate a friction torque in the opposite direction to the rotational direction of the pinions and this friction torque acts as a differential limiting torque. Under this condition, since the differential limiting torque acts so as to restrict the rotation of the carrier 72, that amount of the differential limiting torque transfers to the rear wheel side and a larger amount of torque than the standard torque distribution ratio is distributed to the rear wheel, thereby the front wheel being prevented from slipping when the vehicle runs straight and an excellent turning ability being obtained when the vehicle turns. When the rear wheel slips, since N.sub.B >N.sub.F, similarly, the difference between the third and fourth pinions 75, 76 in rotation number produces a planetary rotation, thereby a friction torque is generated. Under this condition, since the differential limiting torque acts so as to encourage the rotation of the carrier 72, that amount of the differential limiting torque transfers to the front wheel side and a larger amount of torque than the standard torque distribution ratio is distributed to the front wheel, thereby the rear wheel being prevented from slipping. Because the differential limiting torque generates in proportional to the input torque, the distribution ratio between front and rear wheels is always constant, therefore the differential limiting ability is always displayed at a constant rate. The driving force distributed to the front wheel side is inputted to the first sun gear 80 through the front drive shaft 66, the drive pinion 67, the hypoid drive gear 85 of the front differential limiting apparatus 68 and the differential case 78 thereof. The driving force conveyed to the first sun gear 80 is distributed to the second sun gear 81 through the first and second pinions 82, 83 and to the carrier 79 supporting the first and second pinions 82, 83. The driving force distributed to the second sun gear 81 is transmitted to the front right wheel 13 through the right axle shaft 71 and the one distributed to the carrier 79 is transmitted to the front left wheel 10 through the left axle shaft 70. When the vehicle runs in a straight line, since the front left wheel speed N.sub.L is equal to the front right wheel speed N.sub.R (N.sub.L =N.sub.R), in the front differential limiting apparatus 68, the second sun gear 80 rotates at the same speed in the same direction as the carrier 79 and the first and second pinions 82, 83 stop the planetary rotation and rotate integrally with the carrier 79. This integral rotation of the first and second pinions 82, 83 together with the carrier 79 does not produce friction torque between both, therefore, the torque distribution between front left and front right wheels is established at the standard torque distribution ratio T.sub.L :T.sub.R (T.sub.L is a front left wheel torque and T.sub.R is a front right wheel torque) which is determined according to gear specifications, of an even torque distribution ratio of around 50:50. When the front left wheel slips, since the front left wheel rotates faster than the front right wheel (N.sub.L >N.sub.R), then in the differential limiting apparatus 68, the first and second pinions 82, 83 make a planetary rotation to produce differentiation between the left and right wheels, enabling the vehicle to make a smooth turn due to an absorption of the difference between the left and right wheels in rotation number. Further, the planetary rotation of the first and second pinions 82, 83 is accompanied by a thrust load produced from the difference in the helix angles thereof. The thrust load acts at either end of the first and secondpinions 82, 83. Further, the resultant force of the separating and tangential forces at the meshing portions of the gears acts on the first and second pinions 82, 83 and the planetary pin 84, respectively. Both the thrust load and resultant force generate a friction torque in the opposite direction to the rotational direction of the pinions and this friction torque acts as a differential limiting torque. Under this condition, since the differential limiting torque acts so as to restrict the rotation of the carrier 79, that amount of the differential limiting torque transfers to the front right wheel side and a larger amount of torque than the standard torque distribution ratio is distributed to the front right wheel, thereby the front left wheel being prevented from slipping when the vehicle runs straight. When the front right wheel slips, since N.sub.R >N.sub.L, similarly, the difference between the first and second pinions 82, 83 of the front differential limiting apparatus 68 in rotation number produces a planetary rotation, thereby a friction torque is generated. Under this condition, since the differential limiting torque acts so as to encourage the rotation of the carrier 79, that amount of the differential limiting torque transfers to the front left wheel side and a larger amount of torque than the standard torque distribution ratio is distributed to the front left wheel, thereby the front right wheel being prevented from slipping. Because the differential limiting torque generates in proportional to the input torque, the distribution ratio between left and right wheels is always constant, therefore the differential limiting ability is always displayed at a constant rate. Further, the driving force distributed to the rear wheel side by the center differential 62 is inputted to the rear differential limiting apparatus 34 through the rear drive shaft 63, the propeller shaft 32 and the drive pinion 33, and distributed between the rear left and rear right wheels by the rear differential limiting apparatus 34, as described in the second embodiment. Thus, according to the third embodiment of the present invention, since the four wheel drive vehicle incorporates not only the center differential but also the differential limiting apparatus both in the front and rear axles, whenever any one of the four wheels slips or makes an idle rotation, torques proportional to the input torque are properly distributed to the remaining three wheels, i.e., whenever any one loses traction, the remaining ones secure traction, whereby the vehicle driver can enjoy a crisp and stable driving on slippery roads or on rough roads. The center differential according to the third embodiment of the present invention has advantages such as a simple construction, a small number of components, a lightweight, a compact size, an easy assembling, an excellent noise/vibration characteristic in the power transmission system and the like. Further, in the center differential of the present invention, it is possible to establish the number of teeth so as to distribute torque between front and rear wheels at 50:50, and to transfer the differential limiting torque proportional to the input torque to front or rear wheels in accordance with running conditions or road conditions, whereby the vehicle can be prevented from slipping or from unstable behaviors such as a tail drift. The torque control proportional to input torque enables an easy behavior control with respect to the fine accelerator control. Further, the lubrication system of the center differential can be shared with the differential limiting apparatus and in case of employing the automatic transmission it is possible to share ATF among the center differential, the differential limiting apparatus and the automatic transmission. This enables a compactness of the entire casing for accommodating these apparatuses. In the present invention, examples of the differential limiting apparatus have been applied to vehicles on which an engine is mounted on the front side, however, such examples may be applied to a vehicle having an engine on the rear side thereof. Further, these differential limiting apparatuses can be applied to four wheel drive vehicles equipped with conventional differentials on either of the front or rear side. Further, according to the present invention helical gears have been employed in the planetary gear set but the type of gear is not limited to helical gears. While the presently preferred embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described, it is to be understood that these disclosures are for the purpose of illustration and that various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims. * * * * *",

            "fullText":"  ( 1 of 1 ) United States Patent 5,254,052 Kobayashi October 19, 1993 Power transmitting system for a four-wheel drive motor vehicle Abstract A complex central differential is provided for distributing the output of an automatic transmission to front and rear wheels of a motor vehicle. The complex central differential comprises a planetary gear device including a first sun gear operatively connected to an output shaft of the transmission, a carrier, first and second planetary pinions integral with each other and rotatably supported on the carrier, and a second sun gear, and a ring gear. The first planetary pinion is engaged with the first sun gear and with the ring gear, the second planetary pinion is engaged with the second sun gear. The carrier is operatively connected to either of the front wheels or the rear wheels and the second sun gear is operatively connected to the rear wheels. A brake is provided to prevent the ring gear from rotating when output speed of the transmission exceeds a predetermined speed in a first speed range of the transmission, thereby providing the lowest speed.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS FIG. 1 shows a power transmission system in a transaxle type for a four-wheel drive motor vehicle having an engine 10 at a front portion thereof.

The front drive shaft 16 is connected to front wheels through a front differential 19. The output shaft 15 is connected to a rear drive shaft 20 provided in the extension case 6 through the central differential 50 and the control device 60. The rear drive shaft 20 is connected to rear wheels through a propeller shaft 21 and a rear differential 22. The automatic transmission 30 comprises two sets of single planetary gears consisting of a front planetary gear 31 and a rear planetary gear 32 for providing four forward speeds and one reverse speed. The front planetary gear 31 comprises a sun gear 31a, a pair of planet pinions 31d, a ring gear 31b, and a carrier 31c. The rear planetary gear 32 comprises a sun gear 32a, a pair of planet pinions 32d, a ring gear 32b, and a carrier 32c. The input shaft 14 is engaged with the rear sun gear 32a, and the front ring gear 31b and the rear carrier 32c are connected to the output shaft 15. Between a connecting element 33 formed integral with the front carrier 31c and the rear ring gear 32b, a first one-way clutch 34 and a forward clutch 35 are disposed in series. A second one-way clutch 36 and a low and reverse brake 37 are disposed in parallel between the connecting element 33 and the transmission case 3. An overrunning clutch 38 is dispose between the connecting element 33 and the ring gear 32b. On a connecting element 39 integral with the sun gear 31a, a brake band 40 is provided. Between a connecting element 41 integral with the input shaft 14 and a connecting element 42 integral with the carrier 31c, a high clutch 43 is mounted. A reverse clutch 44 is provided between the connecting elements 39 and 41. An oil pump 45 is provided in a front end of the transmission case 3. A pump drive shaft 46 is connected to an impeller 13a of the torque converter 13 and is operatively connected with a rotor of the oil pump 45. In the oil pan 5, a control valve body 47 is provided for hydraulically actuating respective clutches and a brake of the transmission 30. Referring to FIGS. 2a and 2b showing the central differential 50 and the control device 60, a first intermediate shaft 23 is rotatably mounted in the output shaft 15 at a front portion thereof through bushes 28 and a thrust washer 25. A rear portion of the intermediate shaft 23 is rotatably mounted on the rear drive shaft 20 through bushes 28a. The reduction gear 17 is rotatably mounted on the output shaft 15 through a bush 28b and a thrust bearing 25a. The reduction gear 17 and the output shaft 15 are mounted in the transmission case 3 through a ball bearing 26. The central differential 50 is disposed between the output shaft 15, reduction gear 17, and intermediate shaft 23. The central differential 50 is a complex planetary gear device and comprises a first sun gear 51 formed on the output shaft 15, a first planetary pinion 52 meshed with the first sun gear 51, a second sun gear 53 formed on the intermediate shaft 23, a second planetary pinion 54 meshed with the second sun gear 53, and a carrier 55. The carrier 55 comprises a first carrier 55a and a second carrier 55b which are connected by a connecting member 55c. The first carrier 55a is mounted on the output shaft 15 and secured to the reduction gear 17. The first and second planetary pinions 52 and 54 are integral with one another to form a pinion member 58. The pinion member 58 is rotatably mounted on a shaft 56 through needle bearings 27. The shaft 56 is secured to the first carrier 55a and the second carrier 55b. A boss 55e of the carrier 55b formed at the rear end thereof is rotatably mounted on the intermediate shaft 23 through a ball bearing 26c. Thus, the output torque from the output shaft 15 of the transmission 30 is transmitted to the carrier 55 and the second sun gear 53 through the first sun gear 51 and the pinions 52, 54 at predetermined respective torque split ratios. The difference between rotating speeds of the carrier 55 and the second sun gear 53 is absorbed by the rotation of the first and second planetary pinions 52 and 54. The central differential 50 is further provided with a ring gear 57 engaged with the first planetary pinion 52 (or the second planetary pinion 54) for providing the largest reduction gear ratio. The operation of the central differential 50 for distributing the torque to front wheels and rear wheels will be described hereinafter with reference to FIG. 3. Input torque Ti of the first sun gear 51 and the relationship between the sun gears and pinions are expressed as follows, respectively. where T.sub.F is the front torque transmitted from the carrier 55 to the front drive shaft 16, T.sub.R is the rear torque transmitted from the second sun gear 53 to the rear drive shaft 20, rs.sub.1 is the radius of the pitch circle of the first sun gear 51, rp.sub.1 and rp.sub.2 are radii of pitch circles of first and second pinions 52 and 54, respectively, and rs.sub.2 is the radius of the pitch circle of the second sun gear 53. A tangential load P on the engaging point of the first sun gear 51 and the first pinion 52 is equal to the sum of a tangential load P.sub.1 on the carrier 55 and a tangential load P.sub.2 on the engaging point of the second sun gear 53 and the second pinion 54. That is, Substituting equations (1) and (2) for the equation (3), Consequently, it will be seen that the standard torque distribution for the front torque T.sub.F and the rear torque T.sub.R can be set to various values by changing the radii of the pitch circles of sun gears 51 and 53 and pinions 52 and 54. Here, radii rs.sub.1, rp.sub.1, rp.sub.2 and rs.sub.2 of the first sun gear 51, first and second pinions 52, 54 and second sun gear 53 can be replaced with the respective numbers of the teeth Zs.sub.1, Zp.sub.1, Zp.sub.2, and Zs.sub.2. If Zp.sub.1 =Zp.sub.2 =18, Zs.sub.1 =27, and Zs.sub.2 =18, the torque distribution ratio of the front wheels and the rear wheels is A large torque can be distributed to the rear wheels. The control device 60 in the extension case 6 comprises first and second fluid operated multiple-disk friction clutches 61 and 62 for changing the standard torque split ratios to the front and the rear wheels, and a lowest speed brake 63 as a brake for arresting the operation of the central differential 50. The first clutch 61 is provided between the intermediate shaft 23 and the rear drive shaft 20, and comprises a drive drum 61a secured to the intermediated shaft 23 and a driven drum 61b secured to the hub 20a of the rear drive shaft 20. A plurality of drive disks 61f are splined on the drive drum 61a and a plurality of driven disks 61e are splined on the driven drum 61b, disposed alternately with the disks 61f. A ring piston 61d is slidably mounted on the inner wall of the drive drum 61a. An oil chamber 61c is defined between the piston 61d and the drive drum 61a. When the oil is supplied to the oil chamber 61c, the disks 61e and 61f are engaged to engage the clutch 61. The second clutch 62 comprises a drive drum 62a rotatably mounted on a boss 6a of the extension case 6 formed at the inner portion thereof. The inner end of the drum 62a is splined on a connecting member 64 at an end portion thereof. The other end portion of the connecting member 64 is secured to the boss 55e of the second carrier 55b of the carrier 55. A driven drum 62b is secured to a hub 20a of the rear drive shaft 20. A plurality of drive disks 62f are splined on the drive drum 62a and a plurality of driven disks 62e are splined on the driven drum 62b, disposed alternately with the disks 62f. A ring piston 62d is slidably mounted on the inner wall of the drive drum 62a. The piston 62d engages with the end disks 62f. An oil chamber 62c is defined between the piston 62d and the drive drum 62a. When the oil is supplied to the chamber 62c, the piston 62d is pushed by the pressure of the oil. Thus, the disks 62f and 62e are engaged with the adjacent disks to engage the clutch 62 for producing a clutch torque. The lowest speed brake 63 has a drum 63b which is rotatably mounted on the hub 55e of the second carrier 55b and connected to the ring gear 57. A plurality of disks 63e splined on the drum 63b are alternately arranged with a plurality of disks 63f which are splined on the inner periphery of the transfer case 4. A piston 63d is slidably mounted on an inner wall of the extension case 6. An oil chamber 63c is formed between the piston 63d and the extension case 6. A pressing member 63g secured to the piston 63d is engaged with the end disk 63f. When oil is supplied to the chamber 63c, the piston 63d is pushed by the pressure of the oil. The piston 63d pushes the disks 63f and 63e through the pressing member 63g to effect the brake 63, thereby locking ring gear 57 through the drum 63b. The clutches 61 and 62 and the brake 63 are hydraulically controlled by the operation of the system in the control valve body 47. The operation of the automatic transmission 30 for providing the four forward speeds and one reverse speed will be described hereinafter. In a first speed of a drive range or the first speed of a \"2\" or \"3\" range, the forward clutch 35 is engaged. When the vehicle is accelerated, the ring gear 32b is fixed together with the connecting element 33 by engagement of one-way clutches 34 and 36. Thus, the output of the input shaft 14 is transmitted to the output shaft 15 through the sun gear 32a and the carrier 32c. At coasting of the vehicle, the one-way clutches 34 and 36 become free. Accordingly, regardless of the engagement of the overrunning clutch 38, the rotation of output shaft 14 is not transmitted to the engine, so that the engine braking does not effect. In a \"1\" range 1st speed, the low and reverse brake 37 and overrunning clutch 38 are engaged, so that the ring gear 32b is always locked to effect the engine brake. In a drive range 2nd speed or a \"2\" or \"3\" range 2nd speed, the forward clutch 35 and the brake band 40 are engaged to lock the sun gear 31a. The rotation of carrier 31c is transferred to the ring gear 32b through the connecting element 33, forward clutch 35, and one-way clutch 34, increased in speed. When the vehicle is decelerated, the overrunning clutch 38 is engaged to hold the engagement of the connecting element 33 with the ring gear 32b. Thus, the rotation of the output shaft 15 is transmitted to the engine to effect the engine brake. In a drive range 3rd speed or a \"3\" range 3rd speed, the forward clutch 35 and the high clutch 43 are engaged, so that the input shaft 14 is coupled with the ring gear 32b by the high clutch 43 through the connecting elements 41, 42, carrier 31c, connecting element 33, forward clutch 35, and one-way clutch 34. Accordingly, the rear planetary gear 32 is integrated as one unit to directly connect the input shaft 14 with the output shaft 15. At deceleration, the overrunning clutch 38 is engaged for restricting the one-way clutch 34, thereby effecting the engine brake. In a drive range 4th speed, in addition to the drive or \"3\" range 3rd speed operation, the brake band 40 clamps the sun gear 31a. The ring gear 31b is rotated at higher speed and the rotation is transferred to the output shaft 15. In this range, since the rotation is transmitted without one-way clutches 34, 36, the engine brake is always effected. In reverse range (R), the reverse clutch 44 is engaged. The input shaft 14 drives the sun gear 31a. The carrier 31c is fixed together with the connecting element 33 by the engagement of the low and reverse brake 37. The ring gear 31b in the front planetary gear 31 rotates in the reverse direction to drive the output shaft 15 at a large gear ratio, for providing the reverse speed. During the aforementioned operations, the brake 63 for the lowest speed is released. The clutch 61 is engaged to provide the four-wheel drive system. The clutch 62 is engaged to produce a clutch torque for restricting the differential operation corresponding to the slipping of the front wheels and rear wheels. In the lowest speed of the drive range, the brake 63 is engaged to lock the ring gear 57, so that the complex planetary gear device becomes a simple planetary gear device comprising the sun gear 51, planetary pinion 52 and the ring gear 57, thereby providing the lowest speed. In this state, if the gear ratio obtained by the central differential 50 is insufficient, the transmission 30 is shifted to the second speed. If a gear ratio of the second speed is i.sub.2 and a gear ratio obtained by the central differential 50 is ip, a gear ratio of the fifth speed i.sub.EL is represented as In accordance with the aforementioned conditions of gears and pinions of the central differential 50, if Z.sub.L =63, the gear ratio ip is ip=1+(63/27)=3.333. If i.sub.2 is 1.545, i.sub.EL becomes 5.149. Thus, the gear ratio which is larger than that of the first speed is obtained at a proper gear ratio interval. The hydraulic pressure of the clutch 62 is controlled corresponding to the driving conditions of the engine and the conditions on the road surface for producing a necessary transmitting torque. Thus, the four-wheel drive system is established with a torque split control system. The operations of clutches and brakes of the transmission 30 and the control device 60 in relation to the shift ranges are shown in the table 1.

If rotating speeds of ring gear 31b, sun gear 31a and carrier 31c of the front planetary gear 31 are NR.sub.1, Ns.sub.1, Nc.sub.1, respectively, the relationship between the rotating speeds of each element of the front planetary gear 31 is represented by an equation as follows. where .alpha..sub.1 =Zfs.sub.1 /ZR.sub.1. If rotating speed of ring gear 32b, sun gear 32a and carrier 32c of the rear planetary gear 32 are NR.sub.2, Ns.sub.2, and Nc.sub.2, respectively, the relationship between the rotating speeds of each element of the rear planetary gear 32 is represented by an equation as follows. where .alpha..sub.2 =Zrs.sub.2 /ZR.sub.2. Describing the operation of the system, the power of the engine 10 is transmitted through the torque converter 13 and the input shaft 14 to the transmission 30. Accordingly, front and rear planetary gears 31 and 32 are operated and clutches 44, 43, 35, 38, 36, 34 and brakes 40, 37 are selectively actuated, so that the four forward speeds and one reverse speed are provided as described hereinbefore. The output of the transmission 30 is transmitted to the first sun gear 51 of the central differential 50. In order to stably drive the vehicle on roads in general, the second clutch 61 is engaged, thereby connecting the second sun gear 53 of the central differential 50 with the rear drive shaft 20 through the intermediate shaft 23 and the clutch 61. Thus, the first mode, wherein the torque is distributed in accordance with the first standard torque split ratio is selected. Namely, the standard torque split ratio is determined T.sub.F : T.sub.R =40:60, dependent on the number of the teeth of the first and second sun gear 51, 53 and the pinions 52, 54. Thus, 40% of the output torque of the transmission 30 is transmitted to the front wheels through the carrier 55, the reduction gears 17, 18, the first drive shaft 16 and the front differential 19. Meanwhile, 60% of the torque is transmitted to the rear wheels through the second sun gear 53, intermediate shaft 23, second clutch 61, the rear drive shaft 20, the propeller shaft 21 and the rear differential 22. Thus, the four-wheel driving is established. The vehicle is in an oversteering condition so that good cornering maneuverability, driveability and steerability are obtained. When the vehicle makes a turn, the rotating difference in speeds of the front and rear wheels is sufficiently absorbed by the first and second pinions 52, 54 of the central differential 50, thereby preventing the tight corner braking and ensuring good operability. If the vehicle is driven on a slippery road, the rear wheels slip first because the large amount of the torque is distributed to the rear wheels. Thus, the first clutch 62 is engaged at the clutch pressure. Consequently, the clutch torque Tc is produced in the clutch 62. The clutch 62 is provided in parallel with the carrier 55 and the second sun gear 53 of the central differential 50 through the connecting member 64. Accordingly, the clutch torque Tc corresponding to the slip ratio is transmitted from the second sun gear 53 to the carrier 55 to increase the torque to the front wheels. To the contrary, the torque to the rear wheels is reduced to eliminate slipping, thereby improving driveability to ensure good operability and safe driving. When the differential operation restricting torque becomes maximum, the carrier 55 is directly engaged with the second sun gear 53 to lock the central differential 50. Thus, the four-wheel driving is established in accordance with the torque split corresponding to the axle loads of the front and rear wheels. Thus, the torque split is continuously controlled in accordance with the slip condition for preventing the slipping of the four wheels. If the vehicle is running on a steep-inclined road or on a very rough road, a driver operates the shift lever to the lowest speed range or the maximum torque range is automatically selected in accordance with the sensor signal. Therefore, the transmission is shifted to the second speed and the brake 63 is engaged so that the ring gear 57 of the central differential 50 is locked. Thus, a simple planetary gear device is formed for providing the lowest speed. Consequently, the second speed of the transmission is largely reduced in accordance with the central differential 50. The power is transmitted to the front wheels through the carrier 55. Thus, the vehicle can be driven at the lowest speed having a larger gear ratio than the first speed. On the other hand, the transmitting torque TD in the clutch 62 is variably controlled corresponding to the driving conditions and the slipping of the front wheels. The torque is transmitted to the rear wheels through the carrier 55, first intermediate shaft 23 and clutch 62. Thus, the four-wheel drive system is provided. The vehicle is driven in an understeering condition so that the stability of the vehicle at a high speed driving is improved. The torque is transmitted to the rear wheels corresponding to the transmitting torque TD. Therefore, the slipping of the wheels is prevented. FIG. 4 shows a power transmission system of the second embodiment in which the engine 10 is laterally mounted on the motor vehicle at a front portion of the motor vehicle. The torque converter 13 connected to the engine 10 through the crankshaft 11 and the automatic transmission 30 are laterally mounted on the motor vehicle. The front axle differential 19 is housed in the transmission case 3, and a transfer device 65, the central differential 50 and the central differential control device 60 are housed in the transfer case 4. The output shaft 15 of the transmission 30 is connected to an intermediated shaft 73 which is parallel with the output shaft 15, through a pair of gears 72a and 72b. A drive gear 74a fixedly mounted on the intermediated shaft 73 meshes with a final gear 74b which is fixed to opposed hub members 19a. The front axle differential 19 with a bevel gear has a differential case 19b connected to a first tubular output shaft 76 of the central differential 50. In the differential case 19b, there are provided a pinion shaft 19c secured to the differential case 19b, two differential pinions 19d rotatably mounted on the pinion shaft 19c and two bevel side gears 19L, 19R meshed with pinions 19d. The side gears 19L and 19R are connected to left and right front axles 70L and 70R so as to respectively transmit the output power of the transmission to the left and right front wheels 71L and 71R. In the transfer case 4, the central differential 50 and the control device 60 are provided coaxially with the front differential 19 and the axle 70R, and the transfer device 65 is disposed behind the central differential 50. The central differential 50 has a tubular input shaft 75 connected with the hub member 19a, and the output shaft 76 connected to the connecting member 55c of the carrier 55. The first output shaft 76, intermediated shaft 23, and a second tubular output shaft 86 are rotatably mounted on the right front axle 70R. The drums 61b and 62b of the clutches 61 and 62 of the control device 60 are securely mounted on the shaft 86. The central differential 50 comprises first sun gear 51 integrally formed on the input shaft 75, first planetary pinion 52 meshed with the first sun gear 51, second sun gear 53 integrally formed on the intermediate shaft 23, second planetary pinion 54 meshed with the second sun gear 53, and carrier 55. The first carrier 55a and the second carrier 55b are rotatably mounted on the input shaft 75 and the intermediated shaft 23, respectively. Thus, the output torque from the output shaft 15 of the transmission 30 is transmitted to the first sun gear 51 through the drive gear 74a, the final gear 74b, the hub member 19a and the input shaft 75 and further to the carrier 55 and the second sun gear 53 through the pinions 52, 54 at predetermined respective torque distribution ratios. The output torque from the carrier 55 is transmitted to the front differential 19 through the first output shaft 76 and the differential case 19b. The carrier 55 is further connected to the clutch 62 through the second carrier 55b and the connecting member 64. The construction and operation of the control device 60 are the same as those of the first embodiment. A transfer drive gear 77a of the transfer device 65 is securely mounted on the second output shaft 86. The transfer drive gear 77a engages with a driven gear 77b securely mounted on a transfer shaft 78 of the transfer device 65 which is disposed behind the central differential 50. The transfer shaft 78 is connected to the rear drive shaft 20 perpendicular to the transfer shaft 78 through a pair of bevel gears 79a, 79b, thereby transmitting the power to rear axles 80L and 80R connected to the left and right rear wheels 81L and 81R by way of the rear drive shaft 20, propeller shaft 21 and rear differential 22. Describing the operation of the system, the power of the engine 10 is transmitted through the torque converter 13 to the automatic transmission 30 at which the transmission ratio is controlled. The output of the transmission is transmitted to the first sun gear 51 of the central differential 50 through the output shaft 15, the gears 72a, 72b, the intermediate shaft 73, the drive gear 74a, the final gear 74b, the hub members 19a and the input shaft 75. The torque of the carrier 55 is transmitted to the front wheels 71L, 71R through the first output shaft 76, the front differential 19 and the axles 70L and 70R. The torque is transmitted to the rear wheels 81L, 81R through the second sun gear 53, the intermediate shaft 23, the clutch 61, the second output shaft 86, the transfer drive and driven gears 77a and 77b, the transfer shaft 78, the bevel gears 79a and 79b, the rear drive shaft 20, the propeller shaft 21, the rear differential 22 and the rear axles 80L and 80R. Thus, a full-time four-wheel driving is established. Accordingly, in the same manner as the first embodiment, the differential operation is restricted by the multiple-disk friction clutch 62 and the operational range of the transmission is shifted to the lowest speed by the engagement of the clutch 62 and the brake 63. FIG. 5 shows a modification of the second embodiment of the present invention. In the modification, the front differential 19 is disposed adjacent the control device 60 at the same side as the engine 10. The central differential 50 is coaxially provided with the front differential 19 on the right axle 70R behind the engine 10. The final gear 74b is securely mounted on the input shaft 75 which is rotatably mounted on the right axle 70R. The first output shaft 76 supporting the carrier 55 is connected to the differential case 19b of the front differential 19. The transfer drive gear 77a is securely mounted on the hub member 19a. Other construction and operation of the modification are the same as those of the second embodiment. Referring to FIG. 6 showing a further modification of the second embodiment, the central differential 50 and the control device 60 are disposed in the transmission case 3 directly behind the automatic transmission 30. The tubular output shaft 76 is coaxially disposed with a tubular intermediate shaft 73a. The gear 72b meshed with the gear 72a is integrally mounted on the tubular intermediate shaft 73a. The first sun gear 51 of the central differential 50 is integrally formed on the tubular intermediate shaft 73a. The drive gear 74a mounted on the intermediate shaft 73a is integrally formed on the first carrier 55a of the carrier 55. The final gear 74b meshed with the drive gear 74a is mounted on the tubular input shaft 75 through a boss 74c. The tubular input shaft 75 is secured to the differential case 19b of the front differential 19. The fluid operated clutch 62 mounted on the output shaft 76 is connected to an output shaft 76a through a flange portion of the clutch 61. The transfer drive gear 77a of a transfer device 65a is securely mounted on the shaft 76a. The transfer driven gear 77b meshed with the drive gear 77a is secured to the hub member 19b. A tubular shaft 82 is secured to the hub member 19a and rotatably mounted on the right axle 70R. A gear 83a is securely mounted on the tubular shaft 82. A gear 83b securely mounted on the transfer shaft 78 meshes with the gear 83a. In this modification, the power train disposed in the transfer case in simplified. In accordance with the present invention, the central differential for distributing torque to front and rear wheels is effectively used for a lowest speed gear to provide five forward speeds of the transmission. Since the number of the operational ranges of the transmission is increased, the power and fuel consumption of the engine are increased. The lowest speed range is obtained without changing the power train such as the automatic transmission, the central differential and the control device. Thus, the system is compact in size and simplified in construction. During the operation of the selected range of the transmission, the torque distribution is controlled by the central differential having the differential operation restricting system. During the operation of the lowest speed range, the torque distribution is controlled by the differential operation restricting system. Since the central differential comprises a complex planetary gear device, the torque distribution and the gear ratio of the lowest speed can be set to various values. The central differential and the control device are coaxially provided at the rear of the transmission in the small size. Thus, assembling the system becomes easy, and parts of the central differential, and the multiple-disk clutches can be commonly used to various types of the power trains. While the presently preferred embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described, it is to be understood that these disclosures are for the purpose of illustration and that various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims. * * * * *",

Description BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a four wheel drive motor vehicle having a central differential, and more particularly to a control system comprising a fluid operated clutch device for controlling the central differential. A conventional four-wheel drive motor vehicle has the central differential having a control device for restricting a differential operation and for controlling distribution of a torque to front and rear wheels. Recently, the central differential is used for variably controlling the torque distribution, or used as a reduction gear or speed-up gear, thereby improving driveability, operability, stability and braking effect. In order to provide the above mentioned multiple functions of the central differential, it is necessary to provide a plurality of friction engagement elements such as a fluid operated multiple-disk friction clutch and a brake on the differential. It is very important how to dispose these elements on the differential. Japanese Patent Laid-open Application 4-27622 filed by the same applicant discloses a four-wheel drive motor vehicle providing a central differential which comprises a complex planetary gear device and a control device. The control device comprises first and second fluid operated multiple-disk friction clutches and the brake for a 5th speed. The first clutch is provided for transmitting the power of an engine from a transmission to front and rear wheels. The second clutch is provided for restricting the differential operation of the central differential and variably distributing torque to front and rear wheels of the vehicle. The clutches and the brake are independently constructed and disposed side by side along an axis of an output shaft of the transmission. The second clutch is connected to a carrier of the central differential through three connecting parts by welding. Furthermore, an oil chamber of the second clutch is provided in a rotating drum. Accordingly, the transmission becomes long in the axial direction, resulting in increase of the size and weight thereof. Hence the legroom of the vehicle is reduced. Further, a lubrication system for the differential is complicated. Since the control device connected to the central differential is complicated in construction, it is very difficult to mount the control device on the central differential. When a drum of the fluid operated clutch is rotated, pressure of oil in the drum is exerted on a piston mounted in the drum by centrifugal force, so that the control operation for the torque is deteriorated. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An object of the present invention is to provide a system for controlling a central differential for a four-wheel drive motor vehicle having a simple construction to provide a compact system with light weight. Another object of the invention is to provide a control system which prevents pressure of oil caused by centrifugal force from exerting on a piston of a fluid operated clutch, thereby ensuring a desired clutch torque. According to the present invention, there is provided a system for controlling a central differential having first and second output members for distributing power of an engine through a transmission to front and rear wheels respectively, and having a third output member for controlling distribution of the power, the system comprising restricting means having first friction engagement means operatively connected to the second and third output members for restricting differential operation of the central differential and for controlling distribution of the power to the front and rear wheels, transmitting means having second friction engagement means operatively connected to the second output member and either of the front and rear wheels, the restricting means being disposed at the innermost position adjacent an extension of an axis of the central differential, the transmitting means being disposed around the restricting means, and braking means disposed around the transmitting means for the first output member of the central differential. The central differential comprises a planetary gear device including a first sun gear operatively connected to an output shaft of the transmission, a carrier operatively connected to the third output member, first and second planetary pinions integral with each other and rotatably supported on the carrier, and a second sun gear connected to the second output member.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS FIG. 1 shows a power transmission system in a transaxle type for a four-wheel drive motor vehicle having an engine 10 at a front portion thereof. The power transmission system has a torque converter 13 with a lockup clutch 12 mounted in a converter box 1, and a front differential 19 mounted in a differential box 2 behind the torque converter 13.

The front drive shaft 16 is connected to front wheels through the front differential 19. The output shaft 15 is operatively connected to a rear drive shaft 20 provided in the extension case 6 through the central differential 50 and the control device 60. The rear drive shaft 20 is connected to rear wheels through a propeller shaft 21 and a rear differential 22. The automatic transmission 30 comprises two sets of single planetary gears having a front planetary gear 31 and a rear planetary gear 32 for providing four forward speeds and one reverse speed. The front planetary gear 31 comprises a sun gear 31a, a pair of planetary pinions 31d, a ring gear 31b, and a carrier 31c. The rear planetary gear 32 comprises a sun gear 32a, a pair of planetary pinions 32d, a ring gear 32b, and a carrier 32c. The input shaft 14 is engaged with the rear sun gear 32a, and the front ring gear 31b and the rear carrier 32c are connected to the output shaft 15. Between a connecting element 33 formed integral with the front carrier 31c and the rear ring gear 32b, a first one-way clutch 34 and a forward clutch 35 are disposed in series. A second one-way clutch 36 and a low and reverse brake 37 are disposed between the connecting element 33 and the transmission case 3 in parallel. An overrunning clutch 38 is disposed between the connecting element 33 and the ring gear 32b. A brake band 40 is provided on a connecting element 39 integral with the sun gear 31a. A high clutch 43 is mounted between a connecting element 41 integral with the input shaft 14 and a connecting element 42 integral with the carrier 31c. A reverse clutch 44 is provided between the connecting elements 39 and 41. An oil pump 45 is provided on a front end of the transmission case 3. A pump drive shaft 46 is connected to an impeller 13a of the torque converter 13 and is operatively connected with a rotor of the oil pump 45. In the oil pan 5, a control valve body 47 is provided for hydraulically actuating respective clutches and the brakes of the transmission 30. Referring to FIG. 2 showing the central differential 50 and the control device 60. A first intermediate shaft 23 is axially disposed with the output shaft 15. A rear portion of the intermediate shaft 23 is rotatably mounted in the rear drive shaft 20. A second intermediate shaft 24 is rotatably mounted on the first intermediate shaft 23. The reduction gear 17 is rotatably mounted on the output shaft 15 through a bearing 28 and a thrust bearing 25. The reduction gear 17 and the output shaft 15 are mounted on an inside wall 3a of the transmission case 3 through a ball bearing 26a. The central differential 50 is disposed between the output shaft 15, reduction gear 17, and intermediate shafts 23 and 24. The central differential 50 as a complex planetary gear device comprises a first sun gear 51 formed on the output shaft 15, a first planetary pinion 52 meshed with the first sun gear 51, a second sun gear 53 formed on the second intermediate shaft 24, a second planetary pinion 54 meshed with the second sun gear 53, and a carrier 55. Describing the central differential 50 more in detail with reference to FIG. 3, the carrier 55 comprises a flange 55a secured to the reduction gear 17, three arms 55c engaged with slits 55b formed on the flange 55a, and a boss 55d integral with the arms 55c. Three lugs 55e having holes 55i are formed on the circumference of the boss 55d between the arms 55c. Each arms 55c has a U-shaped step portion 55f formed in a central portion thereof. Three step portions 55f are adapted to define a circle the diameter of which is slightly smaller than that of the boss 55d. The first intermediate shaft 23 has a connecting member 57 disposed between the second sun gear 53 formed on the shaft 24 and the first sun gear 51 formed on the input shaft 15. The connecting member 57 has a triangle shape and splines 57a formed on each corner thereof. The connecting member 57 is mounted in the arms 55c of the carrier 55 through the boss 55d and splined to the splines 55g of the step portion 55f with the splines 57a. The first and second planetary pinions 52 and 54 are integral with one another to form a pinion member 58. The pinion member 58 is rotatably mounted on a shaft 56 through needle bearings 27. The shaft 56 is inserted in to a hole 55h of the flange 55a and the hole 55i of the boss 55d between the arms 55c. The boss 55e formed at the rear end of the carrier is rotatably mounted on the second intermediate shaft 24 through a ball bearing 26b and rotatably supported in the transfer case 4 through a ball bearing 26c. Thus, the output torque from the output shaft 15 is transmitted to the carrier 55 and the second sun gear 53 through the first sun gear 51 and the pinions 52, 54 at predetermined respective torque split ratios. The difference between rotating speeds of the carrier 55 and the second sun gear 53 is absorbed by the rotation of the first and second planetary pinions 52 and 54. The operation of the central differential 50 for distributing the torque to front wheels and rear wheels will be described hereinafter with reference to FIG. 4. Input torque Ti of the first sun gear 51 and the relationship between the sun gears 51,53 and pinions 52,54 are expressed as follows, respectively. where T.sub.F is the front torque transmitted from the carrier 55 to the front drive shaft 16, T.sub.R is the rear torque transmitted from the second sun gear 53 to the rear drive shaft 20, rs.sub.1 is the radius of the pitch circle of the first sun gear 51, rp.sub.1 and rp.sub.2 are radii of pitch circles of first and second pinions 52 and 54, respectively, and rs.sub.2 is the radius of the pitch circle of the second sun gear 53. A tangential load P on the engaging point of the first sun gear 51 and the first pinion 52 is equal to the sum of a tangential load P.sub.1 on the carrier 55 and a tangential load P.sub.2 on the engaging point of the second sun gear 53 and the second pinion 54. That is, Substituting equations (1) and (2) for the equation (3), Consequently, it will be seen that the standard torque distribution for the front torque T.sub.F and the rear torque T.sub.R can be set to various values by changing the radii of the pitch circles of the sun gears 51 and 53 and the pinions 52 and 54. Here, radii rs.sub.1, rp.sub.1, rp.sub.2 and rs.sub.2 of the first sun gear 51, the first and second pinions 52, 54 and the second sun gear 53 can be replaced with the respective numbers of the teeth Zs.sub.1, Zp.sub.1, Zp.sub.2, and Zs.sub.2. If Zp.sub.1 =Zp.sub.2 =21, Zs.sub.1 =33, and Zs.sub.2 =21, the torque distribution ratio of the front wheels and the rear wheels is A large torque can be distributed to the rear wheels. Referring to FIG. 5, the control device 60 in the extension case 6 comprises first and second fluid operated multiple-disk friction clutches 62 and 61 for changing the standard torque split ratios to the front and the rear wheels, and a 5th speed brake 63 as a brake for arresting the operation of the central differential 50. The clutches 62 and 61, and the brake 63 are coaxially triplicated on the first intermediate shaft 23 in the radial direction thereof. The first clutch 62 is provided between the first intermediate shaft 23 and the rear drive shaft 20, and comprises a drive drum 66 splined on the first intermediate shaft 23 and a driven drum 65 formed on a front end of the rear drive shaft 20. A plurality of drive disks 62b are splined on the drive drum 66. A plurality of driven disks 62a are splined on an inner periphery of the driven drum 65 and disposed alternately with the disks 62b. A ring piston 62d is slidably mounted on a boss 6a of the extension case 6 formed at the inner portion thereof, and the inner wall of the extension case. An oil chamber 62c is defined between the piston 62d and the extension case 6 so as to prevent the centrifugal oil force from generating. A return spring 62e provided in a spring holder 62f is mounted on the boss 6a to be abutted on the piston 62d. On the piston 62d, a pressure member 68 is mounted through a ball bearing 67 for absorbing the difference of rotating speeds between those of the piston and disks. Referring to FIG. 6, the pressure member 68 comprises a ring gear 68a engaged with the ball bearing 67 (FIG. 5) and a plurality of rods 68b secured to a side thereof to be projected therefrom. The driven drum 65 has a plurality of holes 65a formed on an annular flange thereof corresponding to the rods 68b. The rods 68b are slidably inserted into holes 65a and engaged with a retainer 69 for the disks. When the oil is supplied to the chamber 62c, the piston 62d is pushed by the pressure of the oil. The pressure member 68 is moved toward the driven drum 65 to push the rods 68b in the drum 65 so that the rods 68 are abutted on the retainer 69. Thus, the disks 62a and 62b are engaged with the adjacent disks to engage the clutch 62 for producing a clutch torque. Since the first intermediate shaft 23 is connected to the carrier 55 through the connecting member 57, the carrier 55 is connected to the first clutch 62 through the intermediate shaft 23. In the clutch 62, since the piston 62d is indirectly engaged with the disks on the drum 65, the diameter of the piston is determined irrespective of the diameter of the disk and the drum. Therefore, even if the clutch 62 is provided in the innermost portion of the control device 60, the diameter of the piston can be increased for increasing the clutch torque. The second clutch 61 is provided between the second intermediate shaft 24 and the rear drive shaft 20 and comprises a drive drum 64 splined on the second intermediated shaft 24 and the driven drum 65. A plurality of drive disks 61a are splined on an inner periphery of the drive drum 64. A plurality of driven disks 61b are splined on the driven drum 65 and disposed alternately with the disks 61a. A ring piston 61d is slidably mounted on the inner wall of the drive drum 64. The piston 61d engages with the end disk 61a. An oil chamber 61c is defined between the piston 61d and the drive drum 64. A return spring 61e is provided between the piston 61d and the drive drum 64. When the oil is supplied to the oil chamber 61c, the disks 61a and 61b of the clutch 61 are engaged so that the second intermediate shaft 24 is connected to the rear drive shaft 20 through the clutch 61. The 5th speed brake 63 is provided on the second intermediate shaft 24. A plurality of disks 63a are splined on the drive drum 64. A plurality of disks 63b are splined on the inner periphery of the transfer case 4. A piston 63d is slidably mounted on a boss 4a of the transfer case 4. An oil chamber 63c is formed between the piston 63d and the transfer case 4. A return spring 63e is provided between the piston 63d and the transfer case 4. When oil is supplied to the chamber 63c, the piston 63d is pushed by the oil pressure. The piston 63rd presses the disks 63b and 63a to effect the brake 63. The shafts and drums are supported with each other through bearing 28 and thrust bearings 25. The clutches 61 and 62 and the brake 63 are hydraulically controlled by the operation of the system in the control valve body 47. The operation of the automatic transmission 30 for providing the four forward speeds and one reverse speed will be described hereinafter. In a first speed of a drive, a \"2\" or a \"3\" range, the forward clutch 35 is engaged. When the vehicle is accelerated, the ring gear 32b is fixed together with the connecting element 33 by engagement of the one-way clutches 34 and 36. Thus, the output of the input shaft 14 is transmitted to the output shaft 15 through the sun gear 32a and the carrier 32c. When the vehicle is coasting, the one-way clutches 34 and 36 become free. Accordingly, regardless of the engagement of the overrunning clutch 38, the rotation of output shaft 14 is not transmitted to the engine, so that the engine braking does not effect. In the 1st speed of \"1\" range, the low and the reverse brake 37 and the overrunning clutch 38 are engaged, so that the ring gear 32b is always locked to effect the engine brake. In a 2nd speed of the drive, the \"2\" or the \"3\" range, the forward clutch 35 and the brake band 40 are engaged to lock the sun gear 31a. The rotation of the carrier 31c is transferred to the ring gear 32b through the connecting element 33, the forward clutch 35, and the one-way clutch 34, for increasing in speed. When the vehicle is decelerated, the overrunning clutch 38 is engaged to hold the engagement of the connecting element 33 with the ring gear 32b. Thus, the rotation of the output shaft 15 is transmitted to the engine to effect the engine brake. In a 3rd speed of the drive or the \"3\" range, the forward clutch 35 and the high clutch 43 are engaged, so that the input shaft 14 is coupled with the ring gear 32b by the high clutch 43 through the connecting elements 41, 42, the carrier 31c, the connecting element 33, the forward clutch 35, and the one-way clutch 34. Accordingly, the rear planetary gear 32 is integrated as one unit to directly connect the input shaft 14 with the output shaft 15. At deceleration, the overrunning clutch 38 is engaged for restricting the one-way clutch 34, thereby effecting the engine brake. In a drive range 4th speed, in addition to the drive or the \"3\" range of the 3rd speed, the brake band 40 clamps the sun gear 31a. The ring gear 31b is rotated at higher speed and the rotation is transferred to the output shaft 15. In this range, since the rotation is transmitted without the one-way clutches 34, 36, the engine brake is always effected. In a reverse range (R), the reverse clutch 44 is engaged. The input shaft 14 drives the sun gear 31a. The carrier 31c is fixed together with the connecting element 33 by the engagement of the low and reverse brake 37. The ring gear 31b in the front planetary gear 31 rotates in the reverse direction to drive the output shaft 15 at a large gear ratio, for providing the reverse speed. During the aforementioned operations, the brake 63 for the fifth speed is released. The clutch 61 is engaged to provide the four-wheel drive system. The clutch 62 is engaged to produce a clutch torque for restricting the differential operation corresponding to the slipping of the front wheels and rear wheels. In the fifth speed of the drive range, the brake 63 is engaged to lock the second intermediated shaft 24 and the second sun gear 53, thereby preventing the differential operation of the central differential 50. The carrier 55 serves as a speed-up gear for increasing the speed of the first sun gear 51. In this state, if the gear ratio obtained by the central differential 50 is insufficient, the transmission 30 is shifted to the second speed. If a gear ratio of the second speed is i.sub.2 and a gear ratio obtained by the central differential 50 is ip, a gear ratio of the fifth speed i.sub.5 is represented as In accordance with the aforementioned conditions of gears and pinions of the central differential 50, the gear ratio ip is ip=(33-21)/33=0.363. If i.sub.2 is 1.545, i.sub.5 becomes 0.561. Thus, the gear ratio which is smaller than that of the fourth speed is obtained at a proper gear ratio interval. The hydraulic pressure of the clutch 62 is controlled corresponding to the driving conditions of the engine 10 and the conditions on the road surface for producing a necessary transmitting torque. Thus, the four-wheel drive system is established with a torque split control system. The operations of clutches and brakes of the transmission 30 and the control device 60 in relation to the shift ranges are shown in the table 1.

Describing a lubricating system for the control device 60, an oil passage 70 is formed in the first intermediate shaft 23. The oil ports 71 are communicated with the passage 70 for lubricating the bearings and the thrust bearings 25 on the drums 64, 65 and 66. A plurality of oil ports 72, 73 and 74 are provided in the drive drum 66, driven drum 65 and drive drum 64, for lubricating respective drive disks and driven disks. Describing the operation of the system, the power of the engine 10 is transmitted through the torque converter 13 and the input shaft 14 to the transmission 30. Accordingly, the front and rear planetary gears 31 and 32 are operated and clutches 44, 43, 35, 38, 36, 34 and brakes 40, 37 are selectively actuated, so that the four forward speeds and one reverse speed are provided as described hereinbefore. The output of the transmission 30 is transmitted to the first sun gear 51 of the central differential 50. In order to stably drive the vehicle on roads in general, the second clutch 61 is engaged, thereby connecting the second sun gear 53 of the central differential 50 with the rear drive shaft 20 through the second intermediate shaft 24 and the clutch 61. Thus, the first mode, wherein the torque is distributed in accordance with the first standard torque split ratio is selected. Namely, the standard torque split ratio is determined T.sub.F :T.sub.R =36.4:63.6, dependent on the number of the teeth of the first and second sun gear 51, 53 and the pinions 52, 54. Thus, 36.4% of the output torque of the transmission 30 is transmitted to the front wheels through the carrier 55, the reduction gears 17, 18, the first drive shaft 16 and the front differential 19. Meanwhile, 63.6% of the torque is transmitted to the rear wheels through the second sun gear 53, second intermediate shaft 24, second clutch 61, the rear drive shaft 20, the propeller shaft 21 and the rear differential 22. Thus, the four-wheel driving is established. The vehicle is in an oversteering condition so that good cornering maneuverability, driveability and steerability are obtained. When the vehicle makes a turn, the rotating difference in speeds of the front and rear wheels is sufficiently absorbed by the first and second pinions 52, 54 of the central differential 50, thereby preventing the tight corner braking and ensuring good operability. If the vehicle is driven on a slippery road, the rear wheels slip first because the large amount of the torque is distributed to the rear wheels. Thus, the first clutch 62 is engaged at the clutch pressure. Consequently, the clutch torque Tc is produced in the clutch 62. The clutch 62 is provided in parallel with the carrier 55 and the second sun gear 53 of the central differential 50. Accordingly, the clutch torque Tc corresponding to the slip ratio is transmitted from the second sun gear 53 to the carrier 55 through the clutch 62, the intermediate shaft 23 and the connecting member 57 to increase the torque for the front wheels. To the contrary, the torque to the rear wheels is reduced to eliminate slipping, thereby improving driveability to ensure good operability and safe driving. When the differential operation restricting torque Tc becomes maximum, the carrier 55 is directly engaged with the second sun gear 53 to lock the central differential 50. Thus, the four-wheel driving is established in accordance with the torque split corresponding to the axle loads of the front and rear wheels. Thus, the torque split is continuously controlled in accordance with the slip condition for preventing the four wheels from slipping. If the engine speed is further increased at the fourth speed gear, the transmission is shifted to the second speed and the brake 63 is engaged so that the second sun gear 53 of the central differential 50 is locked to increase the rotating speed of the carrier 55 for providing the fifth speed. Consequently, the second speed of the transmission is largely increased in accordance with the central differential 50. The power is transmitted to the front wheels through the carrier 55. Thus, the vehicle can be driven at a high speed of overdrive having a smaller gear ratio than the gear ratio of the fourth speed. On the other hand, the transmitting torque TD in the clutch 62 is variably controlled corresponding to the driving conditions and the slipping of the front wheels. The torque is transmitted to the rear wheels through the carrier 55, the first intermediate shaft 23 and the clutch 62. Thus, the four-wheel drive system is provided. The vehicle is driven in an understeering condition, so that the stability of the vehicle at a high speed driving is improved. The torque is transmitted to the rear wheels corresponding to the transmitting torque TD. Therefore, the slipping of the wheels is prevented. During four-wheel driving, the lubricating oil is fed to the ports 71 from the oil passage 70 for lubricating the thrust bearings 25, and further fed to drums 64, 65 and 66. The lubricating oil fed to the drum 64 is supplied to the oil chambers, ball bearing 67 and pressure member 68 of the clutches 61 and 62 through two passages. The lubricating oil fed to the drum 66 through one of the passages is supplied to the disks of the clutches 62 and 61, and the brake 63 in order through the ports 72, 73 and 74 by centrifugal force. The oil chamber of the brake 63 is supplied with oil through the transfer case 4. FIG. 7 shows a modification of the control device 60. In a device 60', a brake band 80 is attached to the drive drum 64 in place of the 5th speed brake 63. A viscous coupling 81 is provided between the first intermediate shaft 23 and the driven drum 65 for restricting the differential operation. FIG. 8 shows a power transmission system of the second embodiment in which the engine 10 is laterally mounted on the motor vehicle at a front portion of the motor vehicle. The torque converter 13 connected to the engine 10 through the crankshaft 11 and the automatic transmission 30 are laterally mounted on the motor vehicle. The front axle differential 19 is housed in the transmission case 3, and a transfer device 85, the central differential 50 and the central differential control device 60 are housed in the transfer case 4. The output shaft 15 of the transmission 30 is connected to an intermediated shaft 93 which is parallel with the output shaft 15, through a pair of gears 92a and 92b. A drive gear 94a fixedly mounted on the intermediated shaft 93 meshes with a final gear 94b which is fixed to opposed hub members 19a. The front axle differential 19 with a bevel gear has a differential case 19b connected to a first tubular output shaft 96 of the central differential 50. In the differential case 19b, there are provided a pinion shaft 19c secured to the differential case 19b, two differential pinions 19d rotatably mounted on the pinion shaft 19c and two bevel side gears 19L, 19R meshed with pinions 19d. The side gears 19L and 19R are connected to left and right front axles 90L and 90R so as to respectively transmit the output power of the transmission to the left and right front wheels 91L and 91R. In the transfer case 4, the central differential 50 and the control device 60 are provided coaxially with the front differential 19 and the axle 90R, and the transfer device 85 is disposed behind the central differential 50. The central differential 50 has a tubular input shaft 95 connected with the hub member 19a, and the multiple-disk friction clutch 62. The second intermediated shaft 24 is rotatably mounted on the first output shaft 96. The first output shaft 96 is rotatably mounted on the right front axle 90R. The central differential 50 comprises the first sun gear 51 integrally formed on the input shaft 95, the first planetary pinion 52 meshed with the first sun gear 51, the second sun gear 53 integrally formed on the second intermediate shaft 24, the second planetary pinion 54 meshed with the second sun gear 53, and the carrier 55. The flange 55a and the boss 55d are rotatably mounted on the input shaft 95 and the second intermediated shaft 24, respectively. Thus, the output torque from the output shaft 15 of the transmission 30 is transmitted to the first sun gear 51 through the drive gear 94a, the final gear 94b, the hub member 19a and the input shaft 95 and further to the carrier 55 and the second sun gear 53 through the pinions 52, 54 at predetermined respective torque distribution ratios. The construction and operation of the control device 60 are the same as the first embodiment. A transfer drive gear 97a of the transfer device 85 is securely mounted on the clutch 61. The transfer drive gear 97a engages with a driven gear 97b securely mounted on a transfer shaft 98 of the transfer device 85 which is disposed behind the central differential 50. The transfer shaft 98 is connected to the rear drive shaft 20 perpendicular to the transfer shaft 98 through a pair of bevel gears 99a, 99b, thereby transmitting the power to rear axles 100L and 100R connected to the left and right rear wheels 101L and 101R by way of the rear drive shaft 20, the propeller shaft 21 and the rear differential 22. Describing the operation of the system, the power of the engine 10 is transmitted through the torque converter 13 to the automatic transmission 30 at which the transmission ratio is controlled. The output of the transmission 30 is transmitted to the first sun gear 51 of the central differential 50 through the output shaft 15, the gears 92a, 92b, the intermediate shaft 93, the drive gear 94a, the final gear 94b, the hub members 19a and the input shaft 95. The torque of the carrier 55 is transmitted to the front wheels 91L, 91R through the first output shaft 96, the front differential 19 and the axles 90L and 90R. The torque is transmitted to the rear wheels 101L, 101R through the second sun gear 53, the second intermediate shaft 24, the clutch 62, the transfer drive and driven gears 97a and 97b, the transfer shaft 98, the bevel gears 99a and 99b, the rear drive shaft 20, the propeller shaft 21, the rear differential 22 and the rear axles 100L and 100R. Thus, a full-time four-wheel driving is established. Accordingly, in the same manner as the first embodiment, the differential operation is restricted by the multiple-disk friction clutch 62 and the operational range of the transmission is shifted to the fifth speed by the engagement of the clutch 62 and the brake 63. In accordance with the present invention, the central differential has a control device for providing multiple functions. The control device comprises first and second clutches and a brake which are coaxially triplicated at the rear of the central differential. Thus, the system is compact in size and simplified in the structure. Since the number of parts is reduced, the productivity of the system is improved. The lubricating oil is fed from the inner portion to the outer portion of the control device by centrifugal force for preferably lubricating the respective parts. Thus, durability and reliability of the device are improved with a simple construction. The oil chamber and the piston are provided in the clutch and the brake such that oil pressure exerted on the piston by the centrifugal force is cancelled. Thus, the controlling of the clutch pressure is ensured. While the presently preferred embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described, it is to be understood that these disclosures are for the purpose of illustration and that various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims. * * * * *",

Description BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a power transmission system for a four-wheel drive motor vehicle, and more particularly to a system having a fluid-operated multiple-disk friction clutch for distributing the power of an engine to front and rear wheels of the vehicle. Japanese Patent Publication 61-28531 discloses a system in which a fluid-operated multiple-disk friction clutch is provided as a transfer device for distributing the power of the engine to the front wheels and rear wheels. The clutch is disposed in an extension case of an automatic transmission. The clutch comprises a clutch drum and a clutch hub, each having a plurality of disks, and a piston oil chamber formed between the clutch drum and a piston. The piston is slidably mounted on the hub with splines for pushing the disks of the clutch drum to the disks of the hub. When the clutch hub rotates, the piston rotates together with the hub. When the clutch rotates at a high speed, the centrifugal force of oil in the piston oil chamber is exerted on the piston. When disengaging the clutch, the pressure of the oil is reduced. However, the centrifugal force acts to push the piston to the disks of the clutch drum, so that the clutch cannot be completely disengaged. Further, the centrifugal force causes various disadvantages in accurate control of the pressure of oil. In order to provide a sufficient transmitting torque for the clutch, the diameter of the piston must be enlarged. However, since the piston is mounted on the clutch drum, an increase of the diameter of the piston entails an increase of the diameter of the clutch drum. If the clutch drum becomes large, the resistance of lubricating oil in the clutch during operation becomes large, which causes a reduction of power transmission efficiency. The prior art has a further disadvantage as described below. The multiple-disk friction clutch uses the oil in the automatic transmission as actuating oil for actuating and lubricating the clutch, since the oil has a good friction characteristic and a low oil viscosity. On the other hand, a differential provided between the right and left driving wheels comprises hypoid gears. In such a differential, there is an extreme-pressure lubricant which contains additives to improve the ability to adhere to the surfaces of metals under high bearing pressures Such a lubricant is liable to cause the multiple disks of the clutch to stick and to slip, which causes an unpleasant vibration of the vehicle body. Further, the friction characteristic of the lubricant largely changes with temperature, adversely affects durability and reliability of the clutch. Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open 61-155027 discloses a system in which a pair of transfer clutches for the front wheels and for the rear wheels are provided in a transfer device provided for distributing the torque to the front wheels and the rear wheels. Japanese Patet Application Laid-Open 61-146637 also discloses a system in which a transfer clutch is provided between a final reduction gear of a differential and a transfer device. A piston of the transfer clutch is mounted in the final reduction gear. Accordingly, in such systems, the centrifugal force is similarly exerted on the piston when the power transmission system rotates. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An object of the present invention is to provide a power transmission system in which no centrifugal force is produce in a transfer clutch. Another object of the present invention is to provide a system in which an exclusive oil supply system is provided for the transfer clutch.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS FIG. 1 shows a power transmission system of a four-wheel drive motor vehicle having a trans-axle power transmission system to which the present invention is applied. In a front portion of the motor vehicle, an engine 1, a clutch 2 and a manual transmission 3 are laterally mounted and connected to each other. The power transmission system has a front power train and a rear power train. The front power train has a front differential 4. The rear power train comprises a transfer device 5, a propeller shaft 6, a transfer clutch in the form of a fluid operated multiple-disk friction clutch and a rear differential 8 connected to each other. The power of the engine 1 is transmitted to the transmission 3 through the clutch 2. The output torque of the transmission is transmitted to front wheels F of the vehicle through an output gear 9, a final reduction gear 10, the front differential 4, and axles 4a. The final reduction gear 10 engages with an input gear 11 of the transfer device 5, which is securely mounted on a transfer shaft 5a. The transfer shaft 5a is operatively connected to the propeller shaft 6 through a pair of bevel gears 12, thereby transmitting the power to the transfer clutch 7. The power is transmitted to rear wheels R of the vehicle through a final reduction gear 13, the rear differential 8 and axles 8a at a predetermined distribution ratio determined by the clutch 7. Referring to FIG. 2 showing the transfer clutch 7, a carrier 20 of the rear differential 8 which is suspended from a body of the vehicle has a cylindrical portion 24 as a casing for the clutch 7. The cylindrical portion 24 is integrally formed with the carrier 20 to form an oil chamber 24d therein. An extension case 23 is secured to a front end of the cylindrical portion 24. An input shaft 22 is rotatably mounted in the extension case 23 and connected to the propeller shaft 6. A drive pinion shaft 21a having a drive pinion 21 is rotatably mounted in the carrier 20 of the rear differential 8. An end of the drive pinion shaft 21a is rotatably mounted in a hollow end 22c of the input shaft 22. The drive pinion 21 engages with the final reduction gear 13. The transfer clutch 7 is mounted on the drive pinion shaft 21a in the cylindrical portion 24 and an oil pump 14 is secured to a side of the cylindrical portion 24 for supplying oil to the transfer clutch 7. The transfer clutch 7 comprises a drive drum 7a secured to a flange 22a of the input shaft 22 and a driven drum 7b splined on the drive pinion shaft 21a. A front end of the driven drum 7b engages with a thrust washer 26 which abuts on the end of the input shaft 22. A plurality of drive disks 7c are splined on the drum 7a together with a pair of retainers 7d provided adjacent both end disks 7c, and a plurality of driven disks 7e are splined on the drum 7b, disposed alternately with the disks 7c. A piston 7f is slidably mounted on an inner wall of the cylindrical portion 24 and on a guide cylinder 24c thereof with splines. The piston 7f engages with the outermost retainer 7d through an angular contact bearing 27. A piston chamber 7g is defined by the piston 7f, a partition 24b and the guide cylinder 24c of the cylindrical portion 24. The bearing 27 has an outer race 27a engaged with an operating end of the piston 7f, and splined with the guide cylinder 24c at a projecting end 27b, and an inner race 27c engaged with the retainer 7d and splined on the drum 7a at the outer periphery thereof. Thus, the outer race 27a is engaged with the guide cylinder 24c for preventing rotation of outer race 27a and inner race 27c is engaged with the drum 7a rotating in the same direction. Oil seals 28 and 29 are provided at the inner peripheries of the partition 24b and the extension case 23, respectively. Since characteristics of the oil for the transfer clutch 7 and for hypoid gears of the differential 8 are different from each other, the oil seal 28 is provided for preventing both the oils from mixing. Oil passages 22b and 21b are formed in the hollow end 22c of the input shaft 22 and in the drive pinion shaft 21a, respectively, so as to communicate an outer space of the drive drum 7a with an inner space of the driven drum 7b. When the clutch drum 7a rotates, the oil in the oil chamber 24d in the cylindrical portion 24 is drawn up by the outer, wall of the drive drum 7a, and supplied to the opening of the passage 22b through an oil guide (not shown). The oil passes through the passages 22b and 21b and enters the chamber in the driven drum 7b. Further, the oil is supplied to the disks 7c and 7e through passages (not shown) radially formed in the spline portion of the driven drum 7b. The oil pump 14 is secured to a housing portion 24a formed on the side of the cylindrical portion 24. As shown in FIG. 3, an oil reservoir 14g is provided on the underside of the cylindrical portion 24. A valve unit 25, which will be described hereinafter, is provided in the reservoir 14g. The oil pump 14 has an electric motor 14a, an inner rotor 14b mounted on an output shaft of the motor 14a and an outer rotor 14c engaged with the inner rotor 14b. These rotors are mounted in the housing portion 24a and covered by a cover 14d which is secured to the housing portion 24a by bolts together with the motor 14a. An inlet port 14e is communicated with an oil strainer of the oil reservoir 14g and a discharge port 14f is communicated with the valve unit 25. A hydraulic control system for the transfer clutch 7 is described hereinafter with reference to FIG. 5. The hydraulic control system comprises the valve unit 25 and a control unit 19. The valve unit 25 has a pressure regulator valve 15, a transfer control valve 16, a solenoid operated control valve 17 and a pilot valve 18. Oil from the oil pump 14 is supplied to the pressure regulator valve 15 by which the pressure of the oil is regulated to a predetermined value. The oil is fed to the piston chamber 7g of the transfer clutch 7 through the transfer control valve 16. The pilot valve 18 operates to provide a constant pilot pressure. The solenoid operated control valve 17 is operated by pulses from the control unit 19 at a duty ratio dependent on driving conditions of the vehicle, so that draining of the oil from the control valve 17 provides a control pressure for the transfer control valve 16. The control pressure is applied to an end of the transfer control valve 16 to control the oil supplied to the clutch 7 so as to control clutch pressure. The control unit 19 has a CPU 150 having a memory 151, input interfaces 152, 153 and an A/D converter 154, an output interface 155 and a constant voltage source 156. Output signals from a throttle position sensor 157, a battery voltage sensor 158, a rear wheel speed sensor 159, a front wheel speed sensor 160, a shift range switch 161 and an idle switch 162 are applied to the CPU 150 through the interfaces 152, 153 and the A/D converter 154 for determining the driving conditions of the motor vehicle. An optimum duty ratio is derived from a map stored in the memory 151 in accordance with the vehicle speed and the throttle opening degree detected by the front and rear wheel speed sensors 160, 159 and the throttle position sensor 157, and applied to the solenoid operated control valve 17 through the output interface 155 to provide the control pressure for the transfer control valve 16. FIG. 4 shows a relationship between the control pressure, the clutch pressure and the duty ratio. Describing the operation of the system, the power of the engine 1 is transmitted to the transmission 3 through the clutch 2. The torque is directly transmitted to the front differential 4 and the torque is further transmitted to the rear differential 8 through the transfer clutch 7 for providing four-wheel drive. The disks 7c and 7e of the transfer clutch 7 are soaked in the optimum actuating oil so that a desired friction characteristic is ensured. The controlled pressure is applied to the chamber 7g so that the piston 7f pushes the discs 7c and 7e. Accordingly, the power is distributed to the front wheels and to the rear wheels in accordance with the transmission torque of the transfer clutch 7. The torque distributing ratio is changed in accordance with the clutch pressure controlled by the duty ratio signal from the control unit 19. When the drive drum 7a rotates, the disks 7c and the inner race 27c of the bearing 27 are rotated. However, since the outer race 27a of the bearing 27 and the piston 7f are splined to the guide cylinder 24c of the cylindrical portion 24 through the projecting end 27b, the outer race 27a and the piston 7f do not rotate. Further, the piston chamber 7g is formed by the piston 7f and the cylindrical portion 24 and hence it does not rotate. Accordingly, centrifugal force of the oil in the chamber 7g. Thus, the pressure of the oil in the chamber 7g is accurately controlled, and unnecessary pressure is not exerted on the disks of the clutch 7, so that the torque distribution ratio can be properly controlled. FIGS. 6a and 6b show a modification of the transfer clutch 7. In place of the bearing 27 for the piston of the transfer clutch 7, a thrust bearing 30 is employed. A race 31 of the thrust bearing 30 is engaged with grooves of the guide cylinder 24c at an inner projection 31a. Accordingly, the same effect as described hereinbefore in the previous embodiment is achieved. In accordance with the present invention, the torque distributing ratio is changed to a front-wheel drive mode in which the torque of 100% is transmitted to the front wheels, and to a four-wheel drive mode in which the distribution of torque to the rear wheels is increased. It is possible to control the torque distributing ratio dependent on the driving conditions of the motor vehicle and surface conditions of the road, thereby improving driving stability and driveability. Since the transfer clutch 7 is provided with the oil having a desired characteristic, sticking/slipping of disks does not occur. Thus, uncomfortable oscillation and noise are prevented, and the reliability and durability of the power transmitting system are improved. Since the piston of the clutch is disposed outside the clutch, the diameter of the piston can be increased and the diameter of the clutch can be reduced. Accordingly, resistance of the oil in the clutch is reduced to increase the power transmission efficiency of the clutch. The oil pump and the valve unit for the transfer clutch are disposed adjacent the transfer clutch. Thus, external pipes for the hydraulic system of the clutch are unnecessary and the system is compact in size. Further, leakage of the, oil is prevented and the response of the clutch is quick. FIG. 7 to 10 shows a second embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIGS. 7 and 8, a transfer clutch 32 in the form of a multiple-disk friction clutch is disposed between the final reduction gear 10 and the front differential 4 of the power transmission system. The transfer clutch 32 is mounted on an outside wall of a differential case 33 of the front differential 4. The differential case 33 is used as a driven drum 32b of the clutch 32. A drive drum 32a is secured to a hub of the gear 10 at an end thereof. Secured to the other end of the drive drum 32a is a supporting plate 34 which is rotatably mounted on a hub of the differential case 33 and rotatably supported in a casing 35 through a bearing 35a. The casing 35 is secured to a case of the transmission 3. As shown in FIG. 9, the supporting plate 34 has four windows 34a and is secured to the drive drum 32a at a part of the outer periphery thereof. A plurality of disks 32c are splined on an inner periphery of the drive drum 32a together with a pair of retainers 32d provided adjacent both end disks 32c and a plurality of disks 32e are splined on an outer periphery of the driven drum 32b, disposed alternately with the disks 32c. A ring piston 32f is slidably engaged with an inner periphery of the casing 35. The ring piston 32f is slidably engaged with a knock pin 36 mounted in the casing 35 so as to prevent the piston from rotating. A non-rotatable piston chamber 32g is formed between the piston 32f and the casing 35. A bearing 37 is disposed between the piston 32f and the retainer 32d. The bearing 37 has an outer race 37a engaged with a boss 32h of the piston 32f and an inner race 37b. The inner race 37b has four projections 37c each of which passes through the window 34a of the supporting plate 34 and is splined with the drive drum 32a and engaged with the retainer 32d. The transfer clutch 32 is supplied with oil from an oil pump 14' having substantially the same structure as the oil pump 14 through a hydraulic circuit as shown in FIG. 10. The hydraulic circuit has valves 15a, 16a, 17a and 18a which have the same structure as the valves 15, 16, 17 and 18, respectively, of the hydraulic circuit of the previous embodiment. The hydraulic circuit is controlled by the control unit 19 in the same manner as the previous embodiment. FIGS. 11 to 13 show a third embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIGS. 11 and 12, in the third embodiment, the transfer clutch 32 is provided as a first transfer clutch and another transfer clutch 38 in the form of a multiple-disk friction clutch is provided on the transfer shaft 5a of the transfer device 5 as a second transfer clutch. The transfer clutch 32 is the same as the transfer clutch in the second embodiment. The second transfer clutch 38 comprises a drive drum 38a secured to a flange 11a of an input gear 11b and a driven drum 38b splined to the transfer shaft 5a. A plurality of disks 38c are splined on the drum 38a together with a pair of retainers 38d provided adjacent both end disks 38c and a plurality of disks 38e are splined on the drum 38b, disposed alternately with the disks 38c. A ring piston 38f is slidably engaged with an inner periphery of an annular casing 35a secured to the casing 35. The ring piston 38f is engaged with a knock pin 36a mounted in the annular casing 35a so as to prevent the piston from rotating. A piston chamber 38g is formed between the piston 38f and the casing 35a. A bearing 39 is disposed between the piston 38f and the retainer 38d. The bearing 39 has an inner race 39a engaged with the piston 38f, and an outer race 39b splined on the drive drum 38a and engaged with the retainer 38d. Referring to FIG. 13 showing a hydraulic system of the third embodiment, in order to control the second transfer clutch 38, a second solenoid operated control valve 17b applied with a signal from the control unit 19 and a second transfer control valve 16b communicated with the piston chamber 38g are connected to the hydraulic circuit for the first transfer clutch 32. The second valves 16b and 17b are communicated with the oil pump 14', the pressure regulator valve 15a, and the pilot valve 18a. FIG. 14 shows a modification of the third embodiment. In place of the second transfer clutch 38, another second transfer clutch 41 having the same structure as the transfer clutch 38 is provided on an end portion of the transfer shaft 5a. The transmitting power from the final reduction gear 10 is transmitted to the transfer device 5 through the input gear 11, a drive drum 41a secured to a flange 11c of the input gear 11, and a driven drum 41b splined on the transfer shaft 5a. FIG. 15 shows a further modification. A second transfer clutch 42 is provided between rear drive shafts 6a and 6b connected to the propeller shaft. The construction of the transfer clutch 42 is substantially the same as the clutch 41. FIG. 16 shows a fourth embodiment in which the transfer clutch 32 is provided as a first transfer clutch in the same manner as described in the second embodiment of FIGS. 7 to 10 and a transfer clutch 7A is provided as a second transfer clutch in the same manner as the clutch 7 in the first embodiment of FIGS. 1 to 5. Referring to FIG. 17, an independent hydraulic circuit is provided for the second transfer clutch 7A. The hydraulic circuit has an oil pump 14A, a regulator valve 15b, and a pilot valve 18b in addition to the valves of the circuit shown in FIG. 13. Farther, the system is provided with an FF switch 40a for establishing a front-wheel drive system, an FR switch 40b for establishing a rear-wheel drive system, and a four-wheel control switch 40c. When a signal from the FF switch 40a is applied to the control unit 19, the control unit 19 produces a duty ratio signal of 0% which is applied to the solenoid operated valve 17a of the first transfer clutch 32. The first transfer clutch 32 is entirely engaged and the second transfer clutch 7A is disengaged so that the engine torque is transmitted only to the front wheels F to provide the front-wheel drive system. When a signal from the FR switch 40b is applied to the control unit 19, the duty ratio signal of 0% is applied to the solenoid operated valve 17b of the second transfer clutch 7A. Thus, the first transfer clutch 32 is disengaged and the second transfer clutch 7A is engaged to transmit the torque only to the rear wheels R to provide a rear-wheel drive system. When a signal from the 4WD control switch 40c is applied to the control unit 19, the CPU 150 calculates the duty ratios for the solenoid operated control valves 17a and 17b between 0% and 100% in accordance with a map stored in the memory 151. The solenoid operated valves 17a and 17b actuate to control the oil for the transfer control valves 16a and 16b so that the respective clutch pressures supplied to the transfer clutches 32 and 7A varies in accordance with the driving conditions of the motor vehicle. Thus, a four-wheel drive mode is provided for distributing the torque to the front wheels F and the rear wheels R. When the vehicle turns a corner at a small radius during four-wheel driving, an inside circulating torque is produced in the power transmitting system because of the difference between cornering radii of the front wheels and the rear wheels, which causes a tight corner braking effect on the vehicle. In the system of FIGS. 16 and 17a, 17b the difference between front-wheel speed and rear-wheel speed is detected by the sensors 159 and 160. In accordance with the speed difference, the clutch pressure applied to one of the first and the second transfer clutches is reduced to produce slip in the corresponding clutch, thereby preventing the tight corner braking effect. In accordance with the fourth embodiment, since one of the transfer clutches is disposed in the front differential and the other clutch is disposed in the rear differential which is independently provided, the transfer device is compact in structure. Further, the appropriate driving mode of the vehicle is selected in accordance with the driving conditions for ensuring stability, steerability and starting characteristic of the vehicle. FIGS. 18 and 19 show a power transmission system of a fifth embodiment of the present invention. The transmission system has an engine 51 longitudinally mounted on a front portion of the vehicle, a clutch 52, a synchromesh manual transmission 53 and a transfer device 54, which are disposed in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle. A front differential 57 and a rear differential 58 are connected to the transfer device 54 by way of propeller shafts 55 and 56. Referring to FIG. 19, the transfer device 54 comprises a transfer drive sprocket 61 splined to an output shaft 59 of the transmission 53, a transfer driven sprocket 62 splined to a front drive shaft 60, and a drive belt 63 made of a chain provided between the sprockets 61 and 62. The output shaft 59 is connected to the propeller shaft 56 through a companion flange 64 and the front drive shaft 60 is connected to the propeller shaft 55 through a companion flange 65. A first transfer clutch 66 is provided in the front differential 57 and a second transfer clutch 67 is provided in the rear differential 58. Each of the clutches 66 and 67 has the same structure as the clutch 7 of FIG. 2 and the oil supply system is the same as the system of 17a, 17b. FIGS. 20 and 21 show a sixth embodiment of the present invention. The motor vehicle has an engine 71 at a front portion thereof, a clutch 72, a manual transmission 74, a transfer device 75 having a first transfer clutch 87, and a front differential 73. A rear differential 78 having a second transfer clutch 88 is connected to the transfer device 75 through a propeller shaft 76 and a rear drive shaft 79. Referring to FIG. 21, the transmission 74 has an input shaft 80 operatively connected to a crank shaft 71a of the engine 71 and a hollow output shaft 81 disposed in parallel with the input shaft. A front drive shaft 82 is disposed in the output shaft 81. A drive pinion 82a of the front drive shaft 82 engages with a final reduction gear 73a (FIG. 20) of the front differential 73. The power of the engine is transmitted to the output shaft 81 through the input shaft 80 of the transmission and to the front wheels F through the first transfer clutch 87, the front drive shaft 82, the drive pinion 82a, the final reduction gear 73a and the front differential 73. The output shaft 81 is operatively connected to the rear drive shaft 79 through the transfer drive gears 83a and a driven gear 79a to transmit the power of the engine to the rear wheels R through the propeller shaft 76, the second transfer clutch 88, and a final reduction gear 78a of the rear differential 78. The transfer device 75 comprises the transfer driven gear 79a integrated with the rear drive shaft 79, a gear sleeve 83 mounted on the output shaft 81, the transfer drive gear 83a integrated with the sleeve 83 and engaged with the driven gear 79a, an intermediate shaft 84 secured to a rear portion of the front drive shaft 82, a cylindrical supporting member 85 splined to the intermediate shaft 84, and the first transfer clutch 87 disposed between the supporting member 85 and the gear sleeve 83. The transfer clutch 87 comprises a drive drum 87a secured to a boss of the drive gear 83a, a driven drum 87b splined on a flange of the supporting member 85, a plurality of disks 87c splined on the drum 87a together with retainers 87d, and a plurality of disks 87e splined on the drum 87b, alternately arranged. A ring piston 87f is slidably mounted on the gear sleeve 83 through a seal ring 86a. The piston 87f is slidably engaged with an inner periphery of the drum 87a at an outer flange having an oil seal 86b. A piston chamber 87g is formed between the piston 87f and the drum 87a. A return coil spring 88a is provided between the piston 87f and a retainer 89 secured to the sleeve 83. When the oil in the oil chamber 87g is drained, the piston 87f is pushed by the spring 88a to disengage the clutch. An oil pump 94 for the first transfer clutch 8 is housed in a pump housing 97 disposed in a rear portion of the transmission 74. The pump 94 is operated by the engine through the crank shaft 71a and a pump drive shaft 94a. An inlet of the oil pump 94 is communicated with an oil reservoir 90 attached to the underside of the transfer device 75 through a suction passage 92 and a discharge passage 93 formed in a partition 95. A valve unit 25a is provided in the reservoir 90. Oil seals 96 and 98 are provided in the partition 95 and the pump housing 97, respectively. The second transfer clutch 88 has the same structure as the clutch 7 of the first embodiment. FIGS. 22 and 23 show a seventh embodiment of the present invention. The power transmission system has an engine 101 at a front portion of a motor vehicle, a torque converter 102, an automatic transmission 104, a transfer device 105 and a front differential 103. A rear differential 108 is connected to the transfer device 105 through a propeller shaft 106, and an output shaft 109. The power of the engine is transmitted to the transmission 104 through the torque converter 102. The transmission is a well-known fluid operated automatic transmission. The engine power is transmitted to the front wheels F through the output shaft 109, a first transfer clutch 107, a transfer drive gear 110a, a transfer driven gear 110b of the transfer device 105, a front drive shaft 111, a drive pinion 112, a final reduction gear 113 and the front differential 103. Further, the power from the output shaft 109 is transmitted to the rear wheels R through the propeller shaft 106, a second transfer clutch 128, a final reduction gear 121 and the rear differential 108. Referring to FIG. 23, the first transfer clutch 107 is provided in the transfer device 105 provided on the output shaft 109. The transfer device 105 comprises the transfer drive gear 110a mounted on the output shaft 109 through a needle bearing 122, the transfer clutch 107 disposed between the drive gear 110a and a boss 109a of the output shaft 109. A boss of the drive gear 110a is supported in a transmission case 124 through a bearing 123. The front drive shaft 111 is provided in parallel with the output shaft 109. The transfer drive gear 110a rotatably mounted on the output shaft 109 engages with the transfer driven gear 110b securely mounted on the front drive shaft 111. The drive pinion 112 of the front drive shaft 111 engages with the reduction gear 113 of the differential 103 to transmit the power of the engine to the front wheels. The transfer clutch 107 comprises a drive drum 107a secured to the boss 109a of the output shaft 109 as a drive member, a driven drum 107b secured to the transfer drive gear 110a as a driven member, a plurality of disks 107c splined on the drum 107a through splines together with retainers 107d and a plurality of disks 107e splined on the drum 107b through splines, alternately arranged. A piston 107f is provided in the drum 107a and slidably mounted on the boss 109a of the shaft 109. The piston 107f is slidably engaged with an inner periphery of the drum 107a at an outer flange having an oil seal 125b. The piston 107f is adapted to engage with the retainers 107d. A piston chamber 107g is formed between the piston 107f and the drum 107a. The chamber 107g is communicated with the transfer control valve 16a through an oil passage 109b formed in the shaft 109. A retainer 126 is mounted on the boss 109a of the output shaft 109 and secured by a snap ring 138 and slidably engaged with an inner periphery of the flange of the piston 107f. The retainer 126 has seal rings 139 integrally formed at an outer periphery. Thus, the retainer 126 is watertightly mounted between the output shaft 109 and the piston 107f, thereby defining a centrifugal oil pressure chamber 142 having a large volume, opposite to the oil chamber 107g. A return coil spring 127 is provided in the chamber 142 between the piston 107f and the retainer 126. A check valve 140 is provided in the boss 109a, for communicating the chamber 142 with an oil passage 141 formed in the shaft 109. The structure of the second transfer clutch 128 is the same as the clutch 7 of FIG. 2. The hydraulic control system for the first and second transfer clutches 107 and 128 is similar to the system of FIG. 17. However, as shown in FIG. 24, the oil pump 114 for the first transfer clutch 107 is further communicated with an oil pressure control device 115 for controlling the automatic transmission 104. In accordance with the seventh embodiment, when the centrifugal force of the oil generated in the piston chamber 107g, the piston 107f urges the retainer 107d. However, the centrifugal force of the oil in the chamber 142 is exerted on the piston 107f. Thus, the oil pressure exerted on the piston 107f by the centrifugal force in the piston chamber 107g is cancelled, thereby ensuring the control of the clutch torque. While the presently preferred embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described, it is to be understood that these disclosures are for the purpose of illustration and that various changes and modifications may be made with departing from the scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims. * * * * *",

In a power transmission system for a four wheel drive vehicle having a transmission disposed in a transmission case for transmitting from an output shaft of the transmission output torque from an engine, a front transmitting power train operatively connected to said transmission for transmitting a part of said output torque of the transmission to front wheels of the vehicle, a rear transmitting power train operatively connected to said transmission for transmitting another part of the output torque of the transmission to rear wheels of the vehicle, and transfer clutch means for distributing the output torque of the transmission to the front transmitting power train and the rear transmitting power train, the improvement in the system comprising: a first drum provided in the transfer clutch means and fixedly connected to the rear transmitting power train; a second drum provided in the transfer clutch means and coaxially and operatively engaged with the first drum by oil pressure; one of said drums being operatively secured to said output shaft; a drive gear adjacent and coaxially fixed to the second drum between the transmission and the transfer clutch means and connected to the front transmitting power train so as to be compactly arranged in said case; and said output shaft extends from the transmission; and said drive gear is secured to said output shaft to provide a front-wheel drive based four-wheel vehicle having a larger front axle load distribution to said front wheels than that to the rear wheels so as to perform optimum torque distribution. Description BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a power transmission system for a four-wheel drive motor vehicle, and more particularly to a system having a fluid operated multiple-disk friction clutch. This type of clutch is employed in a transfer device for distributing the output torque of a transmission to auxiliary drive wheels. In such a vehicle, the power transmission system can be converted from a two-wheel drive system to a four-wheel drive system by engaging the clutch. In the four-wheel drive vehicle, there are several layouts of the engine and power trains, such ar a front-mounted engine with front-wheel drive layout, a front-mounted engine with rear-wheel drive layout, and a rear-mounted engine with rear-wheel drive layout. Since distribution between the front axle load and the rear axle load is varied in accordance with the engine an power train layout of the four-wheel drive motor vehicle, it is desirable to design the torque transmission system in accordance with the distribution of axle load. In the layout where the engine and the transmission are mounted on a front portion of the vehicle, the distribution cf the front axle load is larger than the rear axle load. However, the rear axle load becomes large in some layouts. It is desired that the engine power is directly transmitted to the front wheels or the rear wheels in accordance with the layout of the drive line and the distribution of the axle load of the four-wheel drive motor vehicle, thereby improving driveability, driving stability and fuel consumption. Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open 62-143720 discloses a four-wheel drive motor vehicle having a front-mounted engine with rear-wheel drive layout where a transmission output shaft is connected to rear drive wheels and a fluid operated friction clutch is provided on the output shaft. The engine power from the clutch is transmitted to the front wheels of the vehicle through a pair of gears, a shaft provided outside the transmission and a front differential. Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open 62-23823 discloses a four-wheel drive motor vehicle in which the engine power is derived from a fluid operated friction clutch provided on a transmission output shaft through sprocket wheels and chains. Since, in the former prior art, the four-wheel drive motor vehicle having the front-mounted engine with rear-wheel drive layout is constructed on the basis of the two-wheel drive motor vehicle having the front-mounted engine with rear wheel drive layout, it is difficult to alter the system to a front-wheel drive four-wheel system. In the latter four-wheel drive motor vehicle, if the front-mounted engine with rear-wheel drive layout is altered to the front-mounted engine with front-wheel drive layout, problems arise in structure around the transfer clutch, hydraulic circuit for the clutch, structure of bearings, and extension of the case in the axial direction. These problems obstruct the alteration of the layout. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The object of the present invention is to provide a power transmission system for a four-wheel drive motor vehicle in which a transfer system can be easily altered between the front-wheel drive based four-wheel drive system and the rear-wheel drive based four-wheel drive system. According to the present invention, there is provided a power transmission system for a four-wheel drive motor vehicle having a transmission for transmitting power of an engine, a transfer device for distributing the output from an output shaft of the transmission to front wheels and rear wheels, a front power train for transmitting the output of the transfer device to the front wheels, and a rear power train for transmitting the output of the transfer device to the rear wheels.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS FIGS. 1a and 1b are sectional views showing a power transmission system for a rear-wheel drive based four-wheel drive motor vehicle having a front-mounted engine according to the present invention; FIG. 2 is an enlarged sectional view showing a part of the system of FIG. 1; and FIG. 3 is a sectional view showing a part of a system for a front-wheel drive based four-wheel drive vehicle. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT FIGS. 1a and 1b show a power transmission system in a transaxle type for a rear-wheel drive based four-wheel drive motor vehicle having an engine at a front portion thereof. The power transmission system has a differential case 1 made of die casting aluminum, a torque converter 4 with a lockup clutch 3 mounted in a converter box 2, and a differential 6 mounted in a differential box 5 behind the torque converter 4. The differential case 1 has a cylindrical portion 1a, and a lower partition 1b and an inclined partition 1c which define a front side compartment and a rear side compartment. To the rear end of the differential case 1, a shaft supporting plate 8 having a pump housing 7 is attached. An oil pump 10 is housed in the pump housing 7 and a cover 9. A transmission case 11 housing an automatic transmission 12 is attached to the rear of the shaft supporting plate 8. A crankshaft 20 of the engine has a boss 20a to which a drive plate 21 is fixed by bolts 22. A converter cover 23 is secured to the drive plate 21 by bolts 24 at a flange 23a. The torque converter 4 comprises an impeller 25 made integral with the converter cover 23 by welding, a turbine 26 and a stator 27 connected to a hollow stator shaft 32 through a one-way clutch 31. The turbine 26 is fixed by rivets 30 to a disc having a turbine hub 29 which is splined to an input shaft 28 disposed in the stator shaft 32. The input shaft 28 extends into the transmission case 11. The stator shaft 32 is integral with the cover 9 of the oil pump 10. A pump drive shaft 33 surrounding the stator shaft 32 is connected to the impeller 25 and is operatively connected with a rotor of the oil pump 10. In order to prevent leakage of automatic transmission fluid and mixing of the fluid with oil for differential gears, a seal pipe 34 for covering the pump drive shaft 33 is further provided. The front end portion of the seal pipe 34 is tightly embedded in the cylindrical portion 1a of the differential case 1 through a bush 35 and sealed by an oil seal 36 to prevent the oil from leaking. The rear end is tightly embedded in a boss 7a of the pump housing 7. The seal pipe 34 collects the oil leaking from the pump drive shaft 33 and from the oil pump 10 to separate the oil for the differential gears from the oil for the automatic transmission. The lockup clutch 3 of the torque converter 4 has a lockup piston 40 disposed adjacent the converter cover 23. Near the periphery of the lockup piston 40, a facing 41 is attached adjacent the cover 23 for making a contact with the cover 23. A torsion damper 42 is attached to the lockup piston 40 adjacent the turbine 26. A release side oil chamber 43 for applying release pressure to the lockup piston 40 is defined in a front portion of the lockup piston 40. Behind the lockup piston 40, an apply side oil chamber 44 connected to the torque converter 4 is formed for applying lockup pressure to the lockup piston 40. A hollow pilot boss 45 is engaged with the converter cover 23 and is secured thereto. The pilot boss 45 projects out of the converter cover 23 and is engaged with hole 20b formed in the center of the crankshaft 20. The turbine boss 29 has an annular inner boss 29a and an annular outer boss 29b. The pilot boss 45 is mounted in the inner boss 29a, interposing a bush 46 so that the turbine 26 is rotatably supported on the pilot boss 45. Slidably mounted on the inner boss 29a is the lockup piston 40. A hub of the torsion damper 42 engages with the outer boss 29b through splines. The oil in the turbine 26 of the torque converter 4 is further supplied to the apply side chamber 44 to urge the lockup piston 40 toward the converter cover 23. The pressure of oil in the release side chamber 43 is set to a value slightly higher than that of the apply side chamber 44 to disengage the lockup piston 40 from the converter cover 23. A hydraulic circuit for the torque converter 4 comprises an oil passage 47 formed in the input shaft 28 for the release of the lockup clutch 3. The passage 47 is communicated with the release side oil chamber 43 through the hollow of the pilot boss 45. An oil passage 48 formed between the input shaft 28 and the stator shaft 32 is communicated with the turbine 26 and the apply side oil chamber 44. A drain passage 49 for draining the oil in the impeller 25 is formed between the stator shaft 32 and the pump drive shaft 33. The automatic transmission 12 has a well known structure and operates to transmit the power of the engine to an output shaft 13 which is disposed at the rear end of the input shaft 28. A front portion of the output shaft 13 is rotatably mounted on a member 15 secured to the transmission case 11 by bolts 14 through a needle bearing 16. The output shaft 13 is further mounted on a bearing 51 provided in an extension case 50 connected to the rear end of the transmission case 11, and operatively connected to a propeller shaft (not shown) to transmit the power of the engine to the rear drive wheels. Provided under the automatic transmission 12 in the transmission case 11 is an oil pressure control unit 52 above an oil pan 53. A front drive shaft 54 is disposed between the transmission 12 and the oil pressure control unit 52 in parallel with the input shaft 28. A drive pinion 55 of the front drive shaft 54 engages with a crown gear 56 of the differential 6 to transmit the power of the engine to the front drive wheels. A front end of the front drive shaft 54 is supported on the shaft supporting plate 8 through a bearing 60. A flange 60a of the bearing 60 is clamped to the plate 8 by bolts (not shown) for positioning the shaft. A spacer 61 secured to the shaft 54 is disposed adjacent the bearing 60. A reduction driven gear 57 is splined to a rear end of the front drive shaft 54 and clamped by a lock nut 58. The driven gear 57 is rotatably supported in the transmission case 11 and the extension case 50 at the hub thereof through roller bearings 59. Referring to FIG. 2, a transfer device 62 is provided on the output shaft 13. The transfer device 62 comprises a reduction drive gear 64 mounted on the output shaft 13 through a needle bearing 63 and engaged with driven gear 57, and a transfer clutch 70 disposed between the drive gear 64 and a boss 13a of the output shaft 13. The drive gear 64 is supported in the transmission case 11 through a bearing 65, for sustaining radial load generated by the engagement with driven gear 57 and thrust load generated at deceleration. The drive gear 64 abuts against the boss 13a through a thrust bearing 66 for sustaining thrust load. The transfer clutch 70 in the form of a fluid operated multiple-disk friction clutch is provided in the extension case 50. The transfer clutch 70 comprises a drive drum 71 secured to the boss 13a of the output shaft 13 as a drive member, a driven drum 72 secured to the reduction drive gear 64 as a driven member, a plurality of disks 73 splined on the drum 71 through splines 71a, and a plurality of disks 74 splined on the drum 72 through splines 72a, alternately arranged. A piston 77 is provided in the drum 71 and slidably mounted on the boss 13a of shaft 13. The piston 77 is slidably engaged with an inner periphery of the drum 71 at an outer flange 77a having an oil seal 78. An end of the outer flange 77a is adapted to engage with the innermost disk 73. An oil chamber 79 is formed between the piston 77 and the drum 71. Oil is supplied to or drained from the chamber 79 through an oil passage 80 formed in the shaft 13. A cylindrical retainer 82 is disposed in a space between the drive drum 71 and the driven drum 72. The retainer 82 has seal rings 84 integrally formed at an inner periphery and at an outer periphery, respectively. The retainer 82 is mounted on the boss 13a of the output shaft 13 by a snap ring 83 and slidably engaged with an inner periphery of the flange 77a of the piston 77. Thus, the retainer 82 is watertightly mounted between the output shaft 13 and the piston 77, thereby defining a centrifugal oil pressure chamber 85 having a large volume, opposite to the oil chamber 79. A return coil spring 81 is provided in the chamber 85 between the piston 77 and the retainer 82. A check valve 86 is provided in the boss 13a, for communicating the chamber 85 with an oil passage 92 formed in the shaft 13. Describing an oil supply system, the lubricating oil cooled in an oil cooler (not shown) is fed to the oil passage 92 through a passage 90 formed in the transmission case 11 and a port 91 formed in the shaft 13. The oil in the passage 92 is fed to a front portion of the transmission, for lubricating each of the parts in the transmission 12 and to the rear portion through an orifice 93 and ports 94 and 95, for lubricating the transfer device, and drained from a port 96. Although the pressure of oil is reduced while flowing, the oil in the passage 92 has a pressure higher than the spring of the check valve 86 so that the oil can be supplied to the chamber 85. Describing the operation, the engine power is transmitted to the transmission 12 through the input shaft 28 either through the torque converter 4 or through the lockup clutch 3 by controlling the supply of oil to the torque converter. The engine power is transmitted to the output shaft 13 through the transmission and to the rear drive wheels through the propeller shaft. The oil pressure in the piston chamber 79 of the transfer clutch 70 is increased when the vehicle starts at full depression of an accelerator pedal of the vehicle, uphill climbing or is driven on a rough road. The oil pressure is controlled to be low corresponding to a steering angle when the vehicle makes a turn. When oil is supplied to the chamber 79, the piston 77 is pushed by the pressure of the oil. The outer flange 77a of the piston pushes the disks 73 and 74 to engage the transfer clutch 70, for producing a clutch torque corresponding to the clutch pressure. Thus, the power of the engine from the output shaft 13 corresponding to the clutch torque is transmitted to the front wheels through the clutch 70, reduction drive gear 64, reduction driven gear 57, front drive shaft 54, and front differential 6, so that a full-time four-wheel driving system is established. Since the rear wheels are directly connected the output of the transmission 12 to increase the distribution ratio of the torque transmitted to the rear wheels, this structure is appropriate for the motor vehicle having a large rear axle load distribution. In the system, the lubricating oil from the oil passage 92 is supplied to the transmission 12, various bearings and the transfer clutch 70, and further to the centrifugal oil pressure chamber 85 through the check valve 86. When the centrifugal force is exerted on the oil in chamber 79, the piston 77 urges the end disk 73. However, the centrifugal force of the oil in the chamber 85 is exerted on the piston 77. Thus, the oil pressure exerted on the piston 77 by the centrifugal force in the oil chamber 79 is cancelled, thereby ensuring the control of the clutch torque in accordance with the clutch pressure. Referring to FIG. 3 showing the system which is altered to the layout of the front-wheel drive based four-wheel drive vehicle, the output shaft 13 is rotatably supported in the transmission case 11 through the bearing 65. In the extension case 50, a rear drive shaft 100 is rotatably supported through the bearing 51. An end of the rear drive shaft 100 is rotatably mounted on the output shaft 13 through a needle bearing 101 and abuts against the reduction drive gear 64 through the thrust bearing 66. The drive gear 64 is secured to the output shaft 13 with splines. The drum 72 of the transfer clutch 70 is secured to the drive gear 64 at the hub thereof, and the drum 71 is secured to the rear drive shaft 100. In the oil supply system, an oil passage 102 communicated with the oil chamber 79 is formed in the shaft 100. Further, the shaft 100 has an oil passage 103 communicated with the oil passage 92 through an orifice 105. The lubricating oil is fed to the bearings such as the needle bearing 101 through a junction between passages 92 and 103. The oil is supplied to the chamber 85 through a port 104 formed in the shaft 100 and to the clutch 70 through a gap between needle bearing 101 and a retainer of bearing 66. Other structures are the same as the system of FIG. 1. The engine power of the output shaft 13 is transmitted to the front wheels through the reduction drive gear 64, driven gear 57, and the front drive shaft 54. The engine power corresponding to the clutch torque of the clutch 70 is transmitted to the rear wheels, so that the four-wheel driving system is established. Thus, in this embodiment, since the front wheels are directly connected to increase the torque distribution ratio to the front wheels, this structure is appropriate for the motor vehicle having a large front axle load distribution. In accordance with the present invention, the engine and power trains layout are easily altered by changing only a part of components of the the drive line, that is the output shaft 13, the drive gear 64 and rear drive shaft 100. Since the transfer device can be altered to either of the front-wheel drive based system and the rear-wheel drive based system in accordance with the distribution of the front axle load and rear axle load, characteristics of the four-wheel drive motor vehicle are effectively improved. While the presently preferred embodiment of the present invention has been shown and described, it is to be understood that this disclosure is for the purpose of illustration and that various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims. * * * * *",

            "fullText":"  ( 1 of 1 ) United States Patent 5,205,797 Kobayashi ,   et al. April 27, 1993 Torque distribution control system for a four-wheel drive motor vehicle Abstract A planetary gear device as a central differential is provided. The planetary gear device has a first sun gear connected to an output shaft of a transmission, a carrier, first and second planetary pinions rotatably supported on the carrier through a shaft, and a second sun gear. The first planetary pinion is engaged with the first sun gear, and the second planetary pinion is engaged with the second sun gear. Each of the sun gears and the planetary pinions is arranged such that resultant force produced by a separative load and a tangential load at a contact point of the pinion and the sun gear is exerted on a bearing on the shaft, so that friction at the bearing produces a differential operation restricting torque.

Description BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a torque distribution control system for a four-wheel drive motor vehicle having a central differential in a form of a complex planetary gear device. In the four-wheel drive motor vehicle, a torque distribution ratio of front and rear wheels is determined in accordance with a dynamic load ratio of the front and rear wheels and with movement of the center of gravity of the vehicle at acceleration so that the power of the an engine may be most effectively used. In the four-wheel drive vehicle based on front-drive with a front-mounted engine, the ratio of the front torque T.sub.F to the front wheels and the rear torque T.sub.R to the rear wheels is approximately 50:50 (TF:TR.apprxeq.50:50). In the four-wheel drive vehicle based on rear-drive with a front-mounted engine, the ratio of the front torque T.sub.F to the rear torque T.sub.R is approximately 40:60 (TF:TR.apprxeq.40:60). A central differential comprising bevel gears is provided in the former system in which the output torque of the engine is equally distributed, and a central differential having a simple planetary gear device is provided in the latter system. The former system ensures safe driving on a slippery road. If a differential lock device is provided for locking the central differential, the driveability of the vehicle is improved. However, when the vehicle makes a turn at high speed under the differential lock condition, all of four wheels may slip (i.e. the vehicle spins) at the same time, causing difficult driving. In order to ensure driving stability of the vehicle, the torque to the rear wheels is set to a value larger than that to the front wheels by arranging the central differential comprising the simple planetary gear device, so that first the rear wheels may slip. Thus, the vehicle can be safely driven by the front wheels at a small torque while the rear wheels do not drive. Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open 63-176728 discloses a four-wheel drive motor vehicle in which a central differential comprising a simple planetary gear device is provided. The output of the transmission is transmitted to a carrier of the planetary gear device. The torque is distributed to the front wheels through either a sun gear or a ring gear and to the rear wheels through the other gear. The torque to the front and rear wheels is unequally distributed at a ratio determined by the difference between the pitch circles of the sun gear and the ring gear. A fluid operated multiple-disk friction clutch as a lock device is provided for controlling the differential operation. The clutch comprises a drive drum and a driven drum each having multiple-disks, and a piston oil chamber formed between the drive drum and a piston. An electronic control system and a hydraulic control system are provided for controlling the pressure of oil. When oil is supplied to the piston chamber, the piston is urged by the pressure of the oil to push the disks of the drive drum. Thus, the opposite disks are engaged to produce a torque for restricting the differential operation. Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open 60-159444 discloses a system for controlling a differential without electronic and hydraulic control systems. The differential comprises a worm gear and a worm wheel provided between right and left wheels or between the front and rear wheels for permitting the differential operation when a motor vehicle makes a turn. When the vehicle travels on a straight road, the differential is locked because of the irreversible function of the worm gear. In the former system, the system is complicated in construction and becomes large in size because of the hydraulic control system and the electronic control system including a solenoid operated control valve for operating the clutch. Since the pressurized oil is supplied to the clutch for actuating the clutch to restrict the differential operation, a time lag inevitably occurs in the clutch operation. If the length of a hydraulic circuit in the hydraulic system is long, the response in operation is deteriorated, which decreases driveability of the vehicle. Furthermore, the differential operation is largely changed in accordance with fluctuation of the friction between the drive disks and driven disks. Therefore, it is desired to accurately control the pressure of the oil in accordance with driving conditions of the vehicle. In the latter system, since the worm gear is used, the structure of the differential is complicated so that manufacturing cost increases. Further, since the worm gear device has a large sliding resistance, transmission efficiency reduces and wear of the gears increases. The system can not use the same oil of the transmission system the actuating oil so that the system is not provided in the transmission system. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An object of the present invention is to provide a torque distribution control system for a four-wheel drive motor vehicle in which a central differential is provided with a complex planetary gear device for sufficiently restricting differential operation. Another object of the present invention is to provide a system in which the torque distribution at cornering of the vehicle and at slipping of the wheels is properly controlled by restricting the differential operation of the central differential, thereby improving steerability, driveability, and driving stability, and preventing the slipping of the wheels. A further object of the present invention is to provide a system which enables control of a wide torque distribution range with a fluid operated friction clutch. According to the present invention, there is provided a system for controlling a torque distribution to front wheels and rear wheels of a motor vehicle, having a central differential for transmitting output of a transmission to front and rear wheels, the system comprising the cental differential comprising a planetary gear device including a first sun gear, a carrier, first and second planetary pinions integral with each other and rotatably supported on a shaft secured to the carrier, and a second sun gear, the first planetary pinion being engaged with the first sun gear, and the second planetary pinion being engaged with the second sun gear. Each of the sun gears and the planetary pinions is arranged such that a composite force produced by a separative load and a tangential load at a contact point of the pinion and the sun gear exerts on a bearing on the shaft through the corresponding planetary pinion, whereby friction at the bearing produces a differential operation restricting torque. Each of the sun gears and the planetary pinions is a helical gear, each helix angle of the helical gear is determined such that the difference between a thrust load on the first planetary pinion and the thrust load on the second planetary pinion acts to produce a friction between an end of one of the pinions and an outside bearing member. Further according to the invention the total reduction ratio of a front-wheel driving system of the vehicle is larger than the total reduction ratio of a rear-wheel driving system. Other objects and features of the present invention will become understood from the following description with reference to the accompanying drawings .

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS FIG. 1 shows a power transmission system in a transaxle type for a four-wheel drive motor vehicle having an engine 10 at a front portion thereof. The power transmission system has a torque converter 13 with a lockup clutch 12 mounted in a converter box 1, and a front differential 19 mounted in a differential box 2 behind the torque converter 13. A transmission case 3 housing an automatic transmission 30 is attached to the rear of the differential box 2. An oil pan 5 is attached under the transmission case 3. A crankshaft 11 of the engine 10 is operatively connected with the torque converter 13. An input shaft 14 extends from a turbine of the torque converter 13 to the automatic transmission 30. An output of the automatic transmission 30 is transmitted to an output shaft 15 which is aligned with the input shaft 14 for rearwardly transmitting the torque. The output shaft 15 is connected to a front drive shaft 16 which is disposed in parallel under the automatic transmission 30 through a pair of reduction gears 17 and 18 of a central differential 50 housed in a transfer case 4. The front drive shaft 16 is connected to front wheels of the vehicle through the front differential 19. The output shaft 15 is connected to a rear drive shaft 20 through the central differential 50. The rear drive shaft 20 is connected to rear wheels of the vehicle through a propeller shaft 21 and a rear differential 22. The automatic transmission 30 comprises two sets of single planetary gears consisting of a front planetary gear 31 and a rear planetary gear 32 for providing four forward speeds and one reverse speed. The automatic transmission has a high clutch 33, a reverse clutch 34, a brake band 35, a forward clutch 36, an overrunning clutch 37, a low and reverse clutch 38, and one-way clutches 39 and 40. An oil pump 41 is provided in the front end of the transmission case 3. A pump drive shaft 42 is connected to an impeller 13a of the torque converter 13 and is operatively connected with a rotor of the oil pump 41. In the oil pan 5, a control valve body 43 is provided for hydraulically actuating respective clutches and for a brake system of the transmission 30. Referring to FIG. 2 showing the central differential 50, an end of the rear drive shaft 20 is rotatably mounted on the output shaft 15 through needle bearings 23a and a thrust bearing 24. The reduction gear 17 is rotatably mounted on the output shaft 15 through a needle bearing 23 and a thrust bearing 24a, and a boss of the reduction gear 17 is supported in the transmission case 3 through a bearing 25. The central differential 50 is disposed among the output shaft 15, the reduction gear 17 and the rear drive shaft 20. The central differential 50 is a complex planetary gear device and comprises a first sun gear 51 integrally formed on the output shaft 15, a first planetary pinion 52 meshed with the first sun gear 51, a second sun gear 53 integrally formed on the rear drive shaft 20, a second planetary pinion 54 meshed with the second sun gear 53, and a carrier 57. The carrier 57 is rotatably mounted on the rear drive shaft 20 through a bearing 25a and connected to the reduction gear 17 by carrier connecting members 56 projected from the gear 17. The first and second planetary pinions 52 and 54 are integral with each other to form a combined pinion 55 and supported on a shaft 58 through needle bearings 26. The shaft 58 is secured to the gear 17 and the carrier 57. The combined pinion 55 is supported between the reduction gear 17 and the carrier 57 through thrust bearing washers 27 mounted on the shaft 58. Thus, the output torque from the output shaft 15 of the transmission 30 is transmitted to the carrier 57 and the second sun gear 53 through the first sun gear 51 and pinions 52, 54 at predetermined respective torque distribution ratios. In the central differential 50, three combined pinions 55 are provided around the sun gears 51, 53 to form a complex planetary gear device without a ring gear. In order to provide the differential operation, the number of teeth of each of the sun gears 51 and 53 and the pinions 52 and 54 is properly determined, which will be described hereinafter with reference to FIGS. 3a to 3c. Referring to FIG. 3b, if the first sun gear 51 is fixed, the following relationship is obtained on a circumference of the second sun gear 53. Referring to FIG. 3c, if the second sun gear 53 is fixed, the following relationship is obtained on the circumference of the first sun gear 51. If the angular velocities of the first and second sun gears 51, 53 are .omega.S1, .OMEGA.S2, radii thereof are rs1, rs2, the angular velocities of the first and second pinions 52, 54 are .omega.p1, .omega.p2, radii thereof are rp1, rp2, and the angular velocity of the carrier 57 is .omega.c, the equation (1) is expressed as The equation (2) is expressed as Since the first and second pinions 52, 54 are integral with each other, namely .omega.p1=.omega.p2, the equations (3), (4) become If the angular velocity .omega.s1 of the first sun gear 51 is replaced with an input speed Ni, the angular velocity .omega.c of the carrier 57 is replaced with a front wheel speed NF, the angular velocity .omega.s2 of the second sun gear 53 is replaced with a rear wheel speed NR, and the radii rs1, rs2 of the sun gears 51, 53 and the radii rp1, rp2 of the pinions 52, 54 are replaced with the respective numbers of the teeth Zs1, Zs2, Zp1, Zp2, the above equation becomes The operation of the central differential 50 for distributing the torque to the front wheels and the rear wheels will be described hereinafter with reference to FIGS. 4a and 4b. In order to distribute a large standard torque to the rear wheels, the radii of the pitch circles of the sun gears 51 and 53 and the pinions 52 and 54 are properly determined. The input torque Ti of the first sun gear 51 and the relationship between the sun gears 51 and the pinions 52 are expressed as follows, respectively. where T.sub.F is the front torque transmitted from the carrier 57 to the front drive shaft 16, T.sub.R is the rear torque transmitted from the second sun gear 53 to the rear drive shaft 20, rs.sub.1 is the radius of the pitch circle of the first sun gear 51, rp.sub.1 and rp.sub.2 are radii of the pitch circles of the first and second pinions 52 and 54, respectively, and rs.sub.2 is the radius of the pitch circle of the second sun gear 53. A tangential load P on the engaging point of the first sun gear 51 and the first pinion 52 is equal to the sum of a tangential load P.sub.1 on the carrier 57 and a tangential load P.sub.2 on the engaging point of the second sun gear 53 and the second pinion 54. That is, Substituting equations (5) and (6) for the equation (7), Consequently, it will be seen that the standard torque distribution for the front torque T.sub.F and the rear torque T.sub.R can be set to various values by changing the radii of the pitch circles of the sun gears 51 and 53 and the pinions 52 and 54. If rs.sub.1 is 23.824 mm, rp.sub.1 is 16.676 mm, rp.sub.2 is 21.807 mm and rs.sub.2 is 18.693 mm, the front torque T.sub.F and the rear torque T.sub.R are calculated as Thus, the torque distribution ratio of the front wheels and the rear wheels is A large standard torque can be distributed to the rear wheels. The system of the central differential for restricting the differential operation will be described with reference to FIGS. 4a to 4d. As shown in FIG. 4b, each of the first and second sun gears 51 and 53 and the first and second pinions 52 and 54 is a helical gear having a predetermined helix angle. The helix angles of the first and second pinions 52 and 54 are different from each other. A thrust load Ft1 is produced on a contact point of the first sun gear 51 and the first pinion 52 and a thrust load Ft2 is produced on a contact point of the second sun gear 53 and the second pinion 54. Both thrust loads Ft1 and Ft2 are exerted in the opposite directions of the shaft 58 so that sliding friction is produced on the thrust washers 27 by the difference between Fti and Ft2. A separative load Fs1 is produced on the contact point of the first gear train and a separative load Fs2 is produced on the contact point of the second gear train. A resultant force NP1 is produced by the separative load Fs1 and the tangential load P. Similarly, the separative load Fs2 and the tangential load P2 produce a resultant force NP2. Resultant forces NP1 and NP2 exert on the pinions 52 and 54, shaft 58 and the needle bearing 26 so that a rolling friction is produced. In accordance with these sliding and rolling frictions, a friction torque Tf, namely a differential operation restricting torque, is produced in the opposite direction to the rotating direction of the pinions. Because the rotating direction of the pinions 52, 54 changes in accordance with the difference between the front-wheel speed NF and the rear-wheel speed NR, the differential operation restricting torque changes accordingly. Consequently, when NF>NR at the cornering and slipping of the front wheels, and when NF<NR at the slipping of the rear wheels, the torque distribution to the front wheels and the rear wheels is automatically controlled corresponding to the differential operation restricting torque. Referring to FIG. 4c, when NF>NR and the input torque Ti is transmitted to the first sun gear 51 in a counterclockwise direction, the first and second pinions 52 and 54 are revolved in the same direction, and the second sun gear 53 and the carrier 57 are also rotated in the same direction. Thus, the friction torque Tf exerts on the pinions 52, 54 in a clockwise direction opposite to the pinions 52, 54. The separative load Fs1 and the thrust load Ft1 of the first gear train is expressed as where .alpha.1 is the pressure angle of the first pinion 52 and .beta.1 is the helix angle thereof. The resultant force Np1 exerted on the shaft 58 at the first gear train is ##EQU2## Similarly, the separative load Fs2 and the thrust load Ft2 of the second gear train are expressed as where .alpha.2 is the pressure angle of the second pinion 54 and .beta.2 is the helix angle thereof. The resultant force Np2 exerted on the shaft 58 at the second gear train is ##EQU3## A residual thrust force A Ft produced in the first and second pinions 52 and 54 is expressed as ##EQU4## The friction torque Tf is the sum of the frictions of the resultant forces Np1 and Np2 and the residual thrust force .DELTA.Ft, and expressed as ##EQU5## where .mu.1 is the rolling friction torque of the needle bearing 26, .mu.2 is the sliding friction torque of the thrust washer 27, re is the inner radius of the pinion, rd is the outer radius of the thrust washer, and n is the number of the contact surfaces. The balance of the torque in the first and second pinions 52 and 54 is expressed as The above equation is represented as Further, since Ti=TF+TR, the above equation is expressed as Here, if .mu.1 is 0, and .mu.2 is 0, Tf becomes zero. Thus, the same standard torque distribution for the front torque TF and the rear torque TR is obtained. Under such conditions, it is understood that the differential operation restricting torque Tf.multidot.rs2/rp2 corresponds to the friction torque TF. The front torque TF becomes small and the rear torque TR becomes large in accordance with the differential operation restricting torque Tf.multidot.rs2/rp2. Since the resultant forces Np1 and Np2 and the residual thrust force .DELTA.Ft which produce the friction torque TF are proportional to the input torque, the differential operation is restricted in proportion to the input torque. The residual thrust force .DELTA.Ft increases in accordance with the difference between the helix angles .beta.1 and .beta.2 of the first and second pinions 52 and 54. If a bushing or a plane bearing is used in place of the needle bearing 26, the friction coefficient .mu.1 between the pinions and shaft 58 is increased. Thus, it is possible to increase the value of the differential operation restricting torque as well as the friction torque Tf. Referring to FIG. 4d, when NR>NF, the first and second pinions 52 and 54 revolve in the clockwise direction while rotating on the sun gears 51, 53, which is the opposite direction to the rotation of the sun gear 51. Thus, the friction torque Tf is exerted on the pinions 52, 54 in the coutnerclockwise direction. The balance of the torque in the first and second pinions 52 and 54 is expressed as Thus, the front and rear torque TF and TR are expressed as Consequently, in the conditions, the same differential operation restricting torque Tf.multidot.rs2/rp2 as the aforementioned is produced. However, the rear torque TR becomes small and the front torque TF becomes large in accordance with the differential operation restricting torque. Describing the operation of the system, the power of the engine 10 is transmitted through the torque converter 13 and the input shaft 14 to the transmission 30 at which the transmission ratio is automatically controlled. The output of the transmission is transmitted to the first sun gear 51 of the central differential 50. The torque is transmitted to the reduction gear 17 through the carrier 57 and to the second sun gear 53. Accordingly, the torque of the reduction gear 17 is transmitted to the front wheels through the reduction gear 18, the front drive shaft 16 and the front differential 19. The torque of the second sun gear 53 is transmitted to the rear wheels through the rear drive shaft 20, the propeller shaft 21 and the rear differential 22. Thus, a full-time four-wheel driving is established. When NF=NR at straight-ahead running, the second sun gear 53 and the carrier 57 are rotated in the same direction at the same speed. Thus, the first and second pinions 52 and 54 revolve together with the carrier 57 without rotating, so that the friction torque is not generated. The front torque TF of the carrier 57 and the rear torque TR of the second sun gear 53 corresponding to the input torque Ti of the first sun gear 51 are determined in accordance with the standard torque distribution ratio TF:TR=40:60 only as shown by a curve l0 of FIG. 5. At the standard torque distribution ratio, the vehicle is driven under the understeer condition, so that good operability is ensured. If the vehicle is driven on a slippery road, the rear wheels slip first because the larger amount of the torque is distributed to the rear wheels. When NF>NR in which the vehicle makes a turn or the front wheels slip, the pinions 52 and 54 are rotated to provide the differential operation of the central differential 50, so that the rotating difference in the speeds of the front and rear wheels is sufficiently absorbed, thereby preventing tight corner braking and ensuring good operability. On the other hand, because of the rotation of the pinions 52 and 54, the thrust loads dependent on the difference between the helix angles are exerted on one side of the thrust washers 27 and the resultant forces by the separative loads and tangential loads are exerted on the needle bearing 26. Therefore, the friction torque is produced in the opposite direction to the rotating direction of the pinions, and hence the differential operation restricting torque is produced. The restricting torque is exerted on the carrier 57 against the rotation of the carrier. Thus, the torque corresponding to the restricting torque is transmitted to the rear wheels. The torque distribution ratio for the rear wheels becomes larger than the standard torque distribution ratio as shown by a curved line l1 of FIG. 5. Consequently, steerability and operability are improved and the slipping of the front wheels at straight-ahead running is prevented. Furthermore, when NR>NF at the slipping of the rear wheels, the pinions 52 and 54 are rotated on the sun gears in accordance with the speed difference between the front wheels and the rear wheels. The restricting torque operates to urge the rotation of the carrier 57 so that the torque is transmitted to the front wheels. The torque distribution ratio of the front wheels becomes larger than the standard torque distribution ratio as shown by a curved line l2 of FIG. 5, thereby preventing the rear wheels from slipping. Since the differential operation restricting torque is produced in proportion to the input torque, the predetermined split torque to the front and rear wheels varies with the restricting torque. Thus, the operation for restricting the differential operation is constantly performed. Referring to FIG. 6 showing another embodiment of the invention, the central differential 50 is provided with a fluid operated multiple-disk friction clutch 60 which is provided between the carrier 57 and the second sun gear 53. The clutch 60 comprises a drive drum 61 secured to the carrier 57, a driven drum 62 secured to the rear drive shaft 20, a plurality of disks 67 splined on the drum 61, and a plurality of disks 68 splined on the drum 62, alternately arranged. A retainer 69 is mounted on an innermost portion of the transfer case 4. A piston 64 is slidably mounted in the transfer case 4. A pressure plate 66 is connected to the piston 64 through a bearing 65. An oil chamber 63 is formed between the piston 64 and the transfer case 4. When oil is supplied to the chamber 63, the piston 64 is pushed against a spring 70 disposed between the piston 64 and the retainer 69 by the pressure of the oil. The pressure plate 66 pushes the disks 67 and 68 to engage the clutch 60 for producing a differential operation restricting clutch torque. When NF>NR, the front torque TF and the rear torque TR are as follow in accordance with the restricting clutch torque Tc. When NR>NF, the front torque TF and the rear torque TR are as follows. In the second embodiment, at the slipping of the wheels, the restricting torque is produced in the central differential 50 without a time lag in accordance with the friction torque Tf and the restricting clutch torque Tc is produced in the clutch 60. When NF>NR, the torque corresponding to the clutch torque Tc is transmitted to the rear wheels. When NR>NF, the torque corresponding to the clutch torque Tc is transmitted to the front wheels. Thus, the differential operation is restricted by the friction torque Tf which is supplemented with the restricting clutch torque Tc so that it is possible to properly restrict the differential operation. FIG. 7 shows a modification of the planetary gear assembly. In the modification, spur gears 51a to 54a are used in place of helical gears. The differential operation restricting torque is produced in accordance with the friction between the pinions and the needle bearing. The system of the present invention can be employed in a four-wheel drive motor vehicle of other types such as the type of the front drive with a laterally mounted front engine, or the rear drive with a front engine, and a four-wheel drive motor vehicle having a manual transmission, or a continuously variable belt-drive automatic transmission. In the above described embodiments, the differential operation restricting torque is not generated at the straight-ahead running of the vehicle, but is generated only when cornering of the vehicle and slipping of a wheel, which cause the differential operation. More particularly, at straight-ahead running, the torque is distributed to the front and rear wheels at the standard torque distribution ratio, and the planetary pinions 52 and 54 rotate at the same speed as the carrier 57 about the sun gears 51, 53. In order to solve such a problem, in a second modification, the differential is arranged to increase the rotating speed of the carrier 57 connected to the front wheels even if the front wheels and the rear wheels are driven at the same speed at the straight-ahead running, so that the combined pinion 55 comprising the pinions 52 and 54 rotates about the shaft 58. Thus, the restricting torque is produced in the differential which is transmitted to the rear wheels. Here, the total reduction ratio iF of the front-wheel driving system and the total reduction ratio iR of the rear-wheel driving system extending from the central differential 50 are determined as follows. where ZF1 is the number of the teeth of the reduction drive gear 17, ZF2 is the number of the teeth of the reduction driven gear 18, ZF3 is the number of the teeth of a drive pinion 19a of the front differential 19, ZF4 is the number of the teeth of a final gear 19b, ZR1 is the number of the teeth of a drive pinion 22a of the rear differential 22, and ZR2 is the number of the teeth of a final gear 22b. Thus, the total reduction ratio iF and iR are determined as iF>IR. When NF=NR, the rotating speed of the carrier 57 is increased with iF/iR. When NF>NR at cornering, a rate for the increasing speed becomes (iF/iR)/(NF/NR). At cornering, the speed ratio between the front wheels and the rear wheels NF/NR is increased in dependency on the cornering radii, thereby increasing the increasing speed. It is necessary to consider the fluctuation of the effective radii and the wear of the tires of the front and rear wheels and the change of the effective radii of the tires caused by the movement of the center of gravity of the vehicle at acceleration. The speed ratio between the front wheels and the rear wheels is determined such that the front wheel speed NF and the rear wheel speed NR becomes NF>NR. Thus, the total reduction ratios are determined as when the rear wheels slip (NR>NF), the differential operation is effected when the condition becomes NR/NF>iF/iR. In accordance with the present invention, the central differential comprises two pairs of the sun gears and the planetary pinions and the carrier. The system for restricting the differential operation is formed by arranging gears and pinions so that the loads exerted on the contact points of the pinions may be effected to restrict the differential operation. Thus, the construction of the system is simplified with a good transmitting efficiency compared with the system dependent on the worm gear device. Since the contact pressures at the contact points are small, it is advantageous for lubrication. Since the differential operation restricting torque is proportional to the input torque, it is easy to control the driving of the vehicle by operating the accelerator pedal of the vehicle. The differential operation restricting torque can be determined in accordance with the difference between the friction coefficients of the washers and the pinions. In the standard torque distribution, the large torque is transmitted to the rear wheels. Moreover, at cornering and slipping of the front wheels, the torque corresponding to the restricting torque is transmitted to the rear wheels, thereby improving steerability and operability of the vehicle. At slipping of the rear wheels, the torque is transmitted to the front wheels to prevent the slipping, thereby improving the driveability. The clutch can be used for supplementing the restricting torque in the differential with the restricting clutch torque so that the friction force is reduced to improve the transmitting efficiency. While the presently preferred embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described, it is to be understood that these disclosures are for the purpose of illustration and that various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims. * * * * *",

Description BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a device for restricting the differential operation of a differential of a motor vehicle, and more particularly to a device comprising a fluid-operated multiple-disk friction clutch for controlling restriction torque in accordance with driving conditions of the motor vehicle. In a motor vehicle, a differential is provided between the right and left driving wheels to absorb the difference in speeds of the wheels during turning of a corner and distribute driving torque equally to the driving wheels. However, when one of the wheels slips due to a low friction coefficient of the road surface or because of a decrease in the load on the wheel, the total distributed driving torque decreases. In order to prevent such a decrease of the torque, a limited slip differential (LSD) where a multiple-disk friction clutch is disposed therein is provided to automatically restrict the differential operation, thereby transmitting sufficient torque to the wheels to drive the vehicle. However, the LSD is operated to restrict the differential operation in accordance with the change in the driving torque, namely with the operation of the accelerator pedal of the vehicle. Therefore, if the accelerator pedal is depressed or released while turning a corner, it becomes difficult to steer the vehicle because of the operation of the LSD. The LSD is therefore used only for a rear differential of a rear drive vehicle, or of a four-wheel drive vehicle, or for a front differential in a particular type of a front drive vehicle. A viscous coupling containing a high viscous fluid recently has been proposed for restricting the differential operation of the differential. The viscous coupling operates to generate a coupling torque in proportion to the difference between right-wheel speed and left-wheel speed. Thus, the vehicle can be steered while the differential operation is restricted despite the operation of the accelerator pedal. However, since the coupling torque depends only on the difference between the speeds of the right and left wheels, it is also necessary to determine the torque capacity of the viscous coupling in consideration of the difference in effective diameter of the wheels and of deterioration of the coupling. Particularly, in a vehicle having an antilock braking system (ABS) on a brake system, a viscous coupling having a small torque capacity is preferable to prevent locking thereof when the antilock braking is effected. Hence the differential operation may not always be restricted when necessary. In addition, the viscous coupling is operated only in response to the speed difference, and cannot be intentionally controlled in accordance with the driving conditions and conditions of the road surface. Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 62-103227 discloses a system for controlling the differential operation of a differential disposed between right and left wheels. In the system, a fluid operated multiple-disk friction clutch is provided between a differential case and a side gear of a differential for producing the torque for restricting the differential operation. Actuating pressure of oil for the clutch is controlled for changing the differential operation restricting torque in dependency on the difference between the speeds of right and left wheels so as to improve the driveability of the motor vehicle. However, the structure of the clutch is too complicated to be easily installed in an ordinary differential. In addition, the multiple-disk friction clutch uses the oil in the automatic transmission as actuating oil for both actuating and lubricating the clutch, since the oil has a good friction characteristic and a low oil viscosity. On the other hand, a final reduction gear of the differential provided on the outside of the differential case is composed of a hypoid gear. In such a differential, extreme-pressure lubricant contains additives to improve ability to adhere to the surfaces of metals under high bearing pressures. Such a lubricant may cause the multiple disks of the clutch to stick and to slip, which causes unpleasant vibration and noise of the vehicle body. Moreover, the clutch is applied to an independently disposed rear differential of a rear drive vehicle with front-mounted engine or a four-wheel drive vehicle and not to a differential of a front drive vehicle with a front-mounted engine or a rear drive vehicle with a rear-mounted engine having a transmission of the transaxle type. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An object of the present invention is to provide a clutch for restricting differential operation of a differential of a transaxle transmission so as to control a differential restricting torque, thereby improving driveability, steerability, driving stability and starting charactertistics of a motor vehicle in accordance with the driving conditions and conditions of the road surface. According to the present invention, there is provided a device for restricting differential operation for a two-wheel drive motor vehicle having a transaxle in which a transmission, a final reduction gear, and a differential are provided for transmitting output torque of an engine to driving wheels. The device comprises a fluid-operated clutch provided adjacent the differential and disposed between a differential and one of the axles for the driving wheels so as to restrict the operation of the differential, and control means for controlling the clutch pressure of the clutch in accordance with driving conditions of the vehicle. In an aspect of the invention, the fluid operated clutch is provided in a cover secured to the differential and separated from the differential by an oil seal. The clutch is disposed coaxially with the axis of the axles and has an outer drum operatively connected to one of a differential case and the axle, an inner drum operatively connected to the other, a plurality of outer disks secured to the outer drum, a plurality of inner disks secured to the inner drum, a piston slidably mounted in a piston chamber and operated by oil supplied to the piston chamber for engaging the outer disks and inner disks with each other, and a centrifugal oil pressure chamber formed adjacent the piston chamber, whereby centrifugal force of oil in the piston chamber does not occur, and the control means includes means for detecting slipping of one of the right and left driving wheels in accordance with the difference between right wheel speed and left wheel speed, and operating means responsive to the slipping for engaging the fluid-operated clutch. Other objects and features of this invention will become understood from the following description with reference to the accompanying drawings.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS FIGS. 1a and 1b show a power transmission system in a front-wheel drive motor vehicle having an engine 10 longitudinally mounted at a front portion thereof, and a transaxle in which a transmission 20, a final reduction gear 30 and a differential 35 are provided. The engine 10 is connected to the transmission 20 housed in a transmission case 1 and a transmission cover 2 through a crankshaft 11, a clutch 12 and an input shaft 14. The manual transmission 20 has an output shaft 15 parallel with the input shaft 14, five pairs of change-speed gears 21 to 25 corresponding to first to fifth (overdrive) speed gears and synchronizers 26 to 28. The synchronizers 26 to 28 are disposed between the gears 21 and 22, between 23 and 24 and adjacent the gears 25, respectively. A reverse drive gear 29 mounted on the input shaft 14 is operatively connected with a gear formed on one side of a sleeve of the synchronizer 26 through an idler gear (not shown) for reverse drive. A synchronizer operating device 16 protruding out of the transmission case 2 to be operatively connected to a shift lever (not shown) at the driver's seat, is connected with the synchronizers 26 to 28 through a shift rod and shift forks (not shown). The operating device 16 is operated to select one of the first to fifth speed gears 21 to 25 and the reverse gear 29. The output shaft 15 is integral with a drive pinion 31 which engages with a ring gear 32 of the final reduction gear 30 of the differential 35 for front wheels 18R and 18L. The power of the engine 10 is transmitted to the front wheels 18R and 18L through the differential 35 and axles 17R and 17L. A differential restricting clutch 40 is further provided between the differential 35 and the axle 17R so as to restrict the differential operation of the differential 35. The clutch is operated by an oil pressure control unit 52 which is applied with electronic signals from a control unit 60 for controlling the clutch 40 in accordance with various driving conditions. The clutch 40 is supplied with oil by a pump 51 which is provided in the transmission case 1 and driven by a motor 50. Referring to FIGS. 2a and 2b, the differential 35 housed in a differential case 36 integral with the ring gear 32 comprises a pinion shaft 38 rotatably supported in the case 36, a pair of differential pinions 37 rotatably mounted on the pinion shaft 38, and a pair of side gears 39R and 39L meshed with the pinions 37. The side gears 39R and 39L are connected to the axles 17R and 17L through splines, respectively. The differential case 36 has a cylindrical portion 36a rotatably supported in the transmission case 1 through a taper roller bearing 34 and housed in a retainer bearing 41 secured to the case 1. The cylindrical portion 36a is rotatably mounted on the axle 17R through a needle bearing 44. The differential restricting clutch (fluid operated multiple-disk friction clutch) 40 is housed in a bowl-like cover 42 and mounted on the axle 17R and the cylindrical portion 36a of the differential case 36. An oil chamber 42a of the clutch 40 is supplied with oil having characteristics different from that for the hypoid gears of the differential by the oil pump 51 and oil seal 45 is interposed between the clutch 40 and the differential 35 to prevent the different oils from mixing with each other. The clutch 40 comprises an outer drum 40a secured to the axle 17R and an inner drum 40b splined on the cylindrical portion 36a. A plurality of outer disks 40c are splined on the drum 40a and a plurality of inner disks 40d are splined on the drum 40b, disposed alternately with the disks 40c. A ring piston 40f is slidably mounted on an inner wall of the retainer bearing 41 and on an inner guide portion thereof. The piston 40f is engaged with the outermost disks 40c through a thrust bearing 46 and with a spring 40g . A piston oil chamber 40e is defined between the piston 40f and the retainer bearing 41. A hydraulic control system for the clutch 40 is described hereinafter with reference to FIGS. 4a and 4b. The hydraulic control system comprises the oil pressure control unit 52 and the control unit 60. The oil pressure control unit 52 has a pressure regulator valve 53, a pilot valve 57, a clutch control valve 55 and a solenoid operated duty control valve 59 for controlling the differential restricting clutch 40. Oil from the oil pump 51 driven by the motor 50 is supplied to the pressure regulator valve 53 by which the pressure of the oil is regulated to a predetermined value. The oil is fed to the piston chamber 40e of the clutch 40 through an oil passage 54, the clutch control valve 55 and an oil passage 56. The pilot valve 57 operates to provide a constant pilot pressure. The solenoid operated duty control valve 59 is operated by pulses from the control unit 60 at a duty ratio dependent on driving conditions of the vehicle, so that the draining of the oil from the control valve 59 provides a control pressure. The control pressure is applied to an end of the control valve 55 through an oil passage 58 to control the oil supplied to the clutch 40 so as to control the clutch pressure. The control unit 60 is fed with output signals from a left-wheel speed sensor 61, a right-wheel speed sensor 62, a vehicle speed sensor 63, a throttle position sensor 64, a shift range sensor 65, a steering angle sensor 66 and a G-sensor 67, which are provided for determining the driving conditions of the motor vehicle. A left-wheel speed N.sub.L from the left-wheel speed sensor 61 and a right-wheel speed N.sub.R from the right-wheel speed sensor 62 are applied to a speed difference calculator 70 where a speed difference .DELTA.N between the left-wheel speed N.sub.L and the right-wheel speed N.sub.R is calculated in accordance with .DELTA.N=N.sub.L -N.sub.R. When the difference .DELTA.N exceeds a predetermined value, a slip determining section 71 applies a slip signal to a clutch pressure providing section 73. The clutch pressure providing section 73 has a clutch pressure look-up table storing a plurality of maximum clutch pressures P corresponding to the steering angle .theta.. Namely, the pressure decreases as the steering angle .theta. increases. The clutch pressure P is derived from the look-up table in accordance with the steering angle .theta. from the steering angle sensor 66. The derived clutch pressure P is fed to a duty ratio providing section 74 where a duty ratio corresponding to the clutch pressure P is obtained. A duty ratio pulse signal from the duty ratio providing section 74 is applied to the solenoid operated valve 59. When the speed difference .DELTA.N is smaller than the predetermined value, a normal driving determining section 72 applies a normal driving determining signal to a clutch pressure providing section 75 to derive a clutch pressure from a look-up table. The clutch pressure P is derived from the table in accordance with the vehicle speed V from the vehicle speed sensor 63 and the throttle valve opening degree .phi. from the throttle position sensor 64. A large clutch pressure P is derived in high engine load and high vehicle speed ranges. The clutch pressure P is further corrected by a gear ratio e determined by the shift range sensor 65, the steering angle .theta.and an acceleration g detected by the G-sensor 67. That is, the clutch pressure is decreased with an increase of the steering angle .theta. and increased with an increase of the acceleration g so that an optimum clutch pressure in accordance with driving conditions can be provided. The duty ratio signal corresponding to the clutch pressure P is also fed to the solenoid operated valve 59. In a vehicle having an antilock braking system on a brake system, when the antilock braking is effected, an ABS actuating signal is applied to the clutch pressure providing section 75 to render the clutch pressure P zero, thereby releasing the clutch 40. Describing the operation of the system, the power of the engine 10 is transmitted to the manual transmission 20 through the clutch 12. The output of the transmission 20 is transmitted to the front differential 35 through the output shaft 15 and to the front wheels 18R and 18L. While the vehicle is driven, output signals from various sensors representing such factors as the left-wheel speed N.sub.L and the right-wheel speed N.sub.R are fed to the control unit 60 to carry out a program shown in FIG. 5. When the vehicle is driven on a road the friction coefficient of which differs from the right side to the left side, and when one of the wheels 18L and 18R slips, it is determined that the wheel is slipping in accordance with the large speed difference .DELTA.N. Thus, the clutch pressure P for the clutch 40 becomes maximum so that the piston 40f presses the disks 40c and 40d, thereby generating differential operation restricting torque between the differential case 36 and the side gears 39R. As a result, the differential 35 is locked to provide stable driving and to effectively transmit torque to the rear wheels 18L and 18R, thereby ensuring driveability. When the vehicle is normally driven on a dry road, the speeds N.sub.L and N.sub.R are substantially equal (N.sub.L .apprxeq.N.sub.R). Therefore, the clutch pressure P is set to a proper value in accordance with the driving conditions. When the vehicle speed V and the throttle opening degree .phi. are small, the clutch pressure P is set to substantially zero so as to release the clutch 40. More particularly, the solenoid operated valve 59 operates to shift a spool of the clutch control valve 55 against the spring, thereby draining the piston chamber 40e of the clutch 40 through the control valve 55. Thus, the differential 35 becomes free. As a result, the vehicle can be driven around a corner with the differential operation. At a start or at acceleration of the vehicle, when 10 the throttle opening degree .phi. or the vehicle speed V increases, the clutch pressure P also increases, thereby generating differential restricting torque. Thus, good driveability, driving stability, and steerability are ensured. The clutch pressure P varies in accordance with the vehicle speed V, the throttle opening degree .phi., the steering angle .theta.and the gear ratio e to further improve the characteristics. As described above, when the left-wheel 18L rotates faster than the right-wheel 18R (N.sub.L >N.sub.R) and the difference .DELTA.N(N.sub.L -N.sub.R) of the speeds are smaller than the predetermined value, a clutch pressure P derived from the table is applied to the clutch 40, thereby generating restricting torque Tc. Since the differential case 36 rotates faster than the right wheel speed N.sub.R by .DELTA.Nb/2, a torque is transmitted to the right wheel 18R from the case 36 through the clutch 40. Therefore, when the torque is transmitted to the ring gear 32 is Ti, the left wheel torque and the right wheel torque are expressed as (Ti-Tc)/2 and (Ti+Tc)/2, respectively. Thus, a smaller torque is transmitted to the left wheel than to the right wheel. On the other hand, when the right wheel speed is larger than the left wheel speed (N.sub.R >N.sub.L), the left wheel torque is represented by (Ti+Tc)/2 and the right wheel torque is represented by (Ti-Tc)/2, thereby transmitting a larger torque to the left wheels. Thus, by changing the restricting torque Tc of the clutch 40, the differential 35 can be continuously changed from the differential operating state to the locked state. FIGS. 3a and 3b show the second embodiment of the present invention applied to a transaxle power transmission system where an engine 10a is laterally mounted. The same numerals as those in FIGS. 1a to 2b designate the same parts as FIGS. 1, 2a and 2b. The differential restricting clutch 40 is disposed adjacent the differential 35 so that a conventional transaxle need only be slightly modified. The present invention may be adapted to a rear drive vehicle with a rear-mounted engine and also to a vehicle provided with an automatic transmission or a continuously variable transmission. In accordance with the present invention, the differential restricting clutch disposed between the differential case and the side gear operates to produce the torque for restricting the differential operation of the differential. The differential operation restricting torque is changed dependent on the driving conditions of the motor vehicle so that the vehicle can be easily and stably driven on slippery roads. Further, optimum driveability, driving stability, and starting characteristics of the vehicle are obtained and steerability of the vehicle is improved when the vehicle is normally driven without slipping. The differential operation restricting clutch can be easily installed in a conventional transaxle by disposing the clutch adjacent the differential. Since the clutch is provided separated from the hypoid gears, oil having the appropriate characteristic can be used. Thus, the sticking/slipping of disks does not occur when the wheels turn around a corner. Further, the piston chamber does not rotate, so that centrifugal force in the piston oil chamber does not occur, thereby ensuring the control of the clutch pressure. The oil pump and the oil pressure control unit are provided adjacent the clutch, whereby the hydraulic circuit is shortened to quickly actuate the clutch. While the presently preferred embodiments of the present invention have been shown as described, it is to be understood that these disclosures are for the purpose of illustration and that various changes and modifications may be made without departing from scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims. * * * * *",

            "fullText":"  ( 1 of 1 ) United States Patent 5,171,294 Takano ,   et al. December 15, 1992 Torque distribution control system for a four-wheel drive motor vehicle Abstract A system for controlling torque distributed to front wheels and rear wheels of a motor vehicle comprises a planetary gear device including a first sun gear connected to an output shaft of a transmission, a carrier, first and second planetary pinions coupled with each other and rotatably supported on the carrier, and a second sun gear disposed between a front torque transmitting member and a rear torque transmitting member. The first planetary pinion is engaged with the first sun gear, and the second planetary pinion is engaged with the second sun gear. A fluid operated multiple-disk clutch is disposed between the carrier and the rear torque transmitting member so as to restrict the differential operation of the planetary gear device.

Description BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a torque distribution control system for a four-wheel drive motor vehicle having a central differential. In a four-wheel drive motor vehicle, a conventional torque distribution ratio of front wheels and rear wheels is determined in accordance with a dynamic load ratio of the front and rear wheels, considering the movement of the center of gravity of the vehicle at acceleration so that the power of the engine may be most effectively used. In the four-wheel drive vehicle based on mainly front-drive with a front-mounted engine, the ratio of front torque T.sub.F to the front wheels and rear torque T.sub.R to the rear wheels are in the ratio of 50:50. In the four-wheel drive vehicle based on mainly rear-drive with a front-mounted engine, the front torque T.sub.F and the rear torque T.sub.R are in the ratio of 40:60. A central differential comprising bevel gears is provided in the former system in which the output torque of the engine is equally distributes, and a central differential having a simple planetary gear device is provided in the latter system. The former system ensures safe driving on a slippery road. If a differential lock device is provided for locking the central differential, the driveability of the vehicle is improved. However, when the vehicle a turn at high speed under the differential lock all of four wheels may slip (i.e. the vehicle at the same time, causing difficult driving. In order to ensure a driving stability of the vehicle, the torque to the rear wheels is set to a larger than that to the front wheels by arranging the differential comprising the simple planetary gear device, so that first the rear wheels may slip. Thus, the vehicle can be safely driven by the front wheels at a small torque while the rear wheels do not drive. Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open 63-176728 discloses a four-wheel drive motor vehicle in which a central differential comprising a simple planetary gear device is provided. The output of a transmission is transmitted to a carrier of the planetary gear device. The torque is distributed to front wheels through either a sun gear or a ring gear and to rear wheels through the other gear. The torque to front and rear wheels is unequally distributed at the ratio determined by the difference between the pitch circles of the sun gear and the ring gear. A fluid operated multiple-disk friction clutch as a lock device is provided for controlling the differential operation. A wide range of torque distribution ratio determined by the ratio of the pitch circle can not be attained because the diameters of the sun gear and the ring gear are limited. However, it is difficult to change the diameters because of limitation of space. Further, in a power transmitting system where an output shaft of a transmission is inserted in the sun gear of the planetary gear device, the diameter of the sun gear becomes large, which renders the size of a transfer device large and hence the space in the vehicle is reduced. Since the distribution of torque to the rear wheels can not be set to a large value, the control range of the multiple-disk friction clutch becomes small. Consequently, a motor vehicle having good driveability and, controllability can not be provided. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An object of the present invention is to provide a torque distribution control system for a for-wheel drive motor vehicle in which the standard torque ratio of the front wheels and rear wheels can be easily changed. Another object of the present invention is to provide a system which can be applied to any kinds of motor vehicles having various layouts of the power transmission system. A further object of the invention is to provide a system in which a large torque is distributed to the rear wheels, thereby enabling the control of a wide torque distribution range with a fluid operated friction clutch. According to the present invention, there is provided a system for controlling torque distribution to front wheels and rear wheels of a motor vehicle having a transmission having an output shaft comprising a planet gear device including a first sun gear connected to the output shaft of the transmission, a carrier, first and second planetary pinions integral with each other and rotatably supported on the carrier, and a second sun gear, the first planetary pinion being engaged with the first sun gear, and the second planetary pinion being engaged with the second sun gear, a front torque transmitting member operatively connected to the carrier and to the front wheels, a rear torque transmitting member operatively connected to the second sun gear, a fluid operated multiple-disk clutch disposed between the second sun gear and the carrier, so as to restrict the differential operation of the planetary gear device, and control means for controlling the clutch torque of the multiple-disk clutch in accordance with driving conditions of the vehicle. The other objects and features of this invention will become understood from the following description with reference to the accompanying drawings.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS FIG. 1 shows a power transmission system in a transaxle type for a four-wheel drive motor vehicle having an engine 10 at a front portion thereof. The power transmission system has a torque converter 13 with a lockup clutch 12 mounted in a converter box 1, and a front differential 19 mounted in a differential box 2 behind the torque converter 13. A transmission case 3 housing an automatic transmission 30 is attached to the rear of the differential box 2. An oil pan 5 is attached under the transmission case 3. A crankshaft 11 of the engine 10 is operatively connected with the torque converter 13. An input shaft 1 extends from a turbine of the torque converter 13 to the automatic transmission 30. The output of the automatic transmission 30 is transmitted to an output shaft 15 which is aligned with the input shaft 14 for transmitting the torque rearwardly. The output shaft 15 is connected a front drive shaft 16 which is disposed in parallel under the automatic transmission 30 through a pair of reduction gears 17 and 18 of a central differential 50 housed in a transfer case 4. The front drive shaft 16 is connected to front wheels of the vehicle through a front differential 19. The output shaft 15 is connected to a rear drive shaft 20 through the central differential 50. The rear drive shaft 20 is connected to rear wheels of the vehicle through a propeller shaft 21 and a rear differential 22. A fluid operated multiple disk friction clutch 60 is provided in the central differential 50. The automatic transmission 30 comprises two sets of single planetary gears consisting of a front planetary gear 31 and a rear planetary gear 32 for providing four forward speeds and one reverse speed. The automat transmission has a high clutch 33, a reverse clutch 34, a brake band 35, a forward clutch 36, an overrunning clutch 37, a low and reverse clutch 38, and one-way clutches 39 and 40. An oil pump 41 is provided in the front end of the transmission case 3. A pump drive shaft 4 is connected to an impeller 13a of the torque converter 13 and is operatively connected with a rotor of the oil pump 41. In the oil pan 5, a control valve body 43 is provided for hydraulically actuating the respective clutches and brake of the transmission 30. Referring to FIG. 2a showing the central differential 50, an end of the rear drive shaft 20 is rotatably mounted on the output shaft 15 through a pair of needle bearings 23a and a thrust bearing 24. The reduction gear 17 is rotatably mounted on the output shaft 15 through a pair of needle bearings 17a, and a boss of the reduction gear 17 is supported in the transmission case 3 through a bearing 25. The central differential 50 is disposed between the output shaft 15, reduction gear 17 and rear drive shaft 20. The central differential 50 is a complex planetary gear device and comprises a first sun gear 51 integrally formed on the output shaft 15, a first planetary pinion 52 meshed with the first sun gear 51, a second sun gear 53 integrally formed on the rear drive shaft 20, a second planetary pinion 54 meshed with the second sun gear 53, a carrier 57. The carrier 57 is rotatably mounted on the drive shaft 20 through a bearing 25a and connected to the reduction gear 17 by carrier connecting members 55 projecting from the gear 17. The first and second planetary pinions 52 and 54 are coupled with each other and supported on a shaft 56 through needle bearings 23b. The shaft 56 is secured to the gear 17 and the carrier 57. Thus, the output torque from the output shaft 15 of the transmission 30 is transmitted to the carrier 57 and the second sun gear 53 through the first sun gear 51 and pinions 52, 54 at predetermined respective torque distribution ratios. The difference between rotating speeds of the carrier 57 and the second sun gear 53 is absorbed by the rotation and revolution of the first and second planetary pinions 52 and 54. The operation of the central differential 50 for distributing the torque to the front wheels and the rear wheels will be described hereinafter with reference to FIG. 3. Input torque Ti of the first sun gear 51 and the relationship between the sun gears and the pinions are expressed as follows, respectively. where T.sub.F is the front torque transmitted from the carrier 57 to the front drive shaft 16, T.sub.R is the rear torque transmitted from the second sun gear 53 to rear drive shaft 20, rs.sub.1 is the radius of the pitch circle of the first sun gear 51, rp.sub.1 and rp.sub.2 are radii of pitch circles of the first and second pinions 52 and 54, respectively, and rs.sub.2 is the radius of the pitch circle of the second sun gear 53. A tangential load P on the engaging point of the first sun gear 51 and the first pinion 52 is equal to the sum of a tangential load P.sub.1 on the carrier 57 and a tangential load P.sub.2 on the engaging point of the second sun gear 53 and the second pinion 54. That is, ##EQU1## Substituting equations (1) and (2) for the equation (3), Consequently, it will be seen that the standard torque distribution for the front torque T.sub.F and the rear torque T.sub.R can be set to various values by changing the radii of the pitch circles of the sun gears 51 and 53 and the pinions 52 and 54. If rs.sub.1 is 23.5 mm, rp.sub.1 is 16.5 mm, rp.sub.2 is 18.8 mm and rs.sub.2 is 21.2 mm, the front torque T.sub.F and the rear torque T.sub.R are calculated as Thus, the torque distribution ratio of the front wheels and the rear wheels is A large standard torque can be distributed to the rear wheels. The clutch 60 comprises a drive drum 61 secured to the carrier 57, a driven drum 62 secured to the rear drive shaft 20, a plurality of disks 67 splined on the drum 61, and a plurality of disks 67a splined on the drum 62, alternately arranged. A retainer 67b is abutted at an innermost disk 67a. A piston 64 is slidably mounted in the transfer case 4. A pressure plate 66 is connected to the piston 64 through a bearing 65 and engaged with a retainer 67c of the drum 61. An oil chamber 63 is formed between the piston 64 and the transfer case 4. Thus, the clutch 60 is provided between the carrier 57 and the second sun gear 53 so as to change the torque distribution ratio and to lock the central differential. When oil is supplied to the chamber 63 the piston 64 is pushed by the pressure of the oil. The pressure plate 66 pushes the disks 67 and 67a to engage the clutch 60 for producing a clutch torque. A front-wheel speed sensor 91 is mounted on the transmission case 3 such that a pickup 91b of the sensor 91 is disposed adjacent to a parking gear 91a secured to the reduction gear 18 for detecting front-wheel speed N.sub.F. A rear-wheel speed sensor 92 is mounted on the transfer case 4 so as to dispose a pickup 92b adjacent to a pulse gear 92a secured to the rear drive shaft 20 for detecting a rear-wheel speed N.sub.R. Referring to FIG. 4 showing a control system for the clutch 60, a hydraulic circuit of the control system comprises a pressure regulator valve 80, a pilot valve 84, a clutch control valve 82 and a solenoid operated duty control valve 87. The regulator valve 80 operates to regulate the pressure of oil supplied from the oil pump 41 driven by the engine to produce a line pressure and the line pressure is applied to a line pressure conduit 81 for controlling the transmission. The conduit 81 is communicated with a passage 86 through the pilot valve 84. The passage 86 is communicated with the solenoid valve 87 downstream of an orifice 85, and with an end of the clutch control valve 82. The conduit 81 is communicated with the clutch control valve 82 through a passage 81a. The clutch control valve 82 is communicated with the clutch 60 through a passage 83. The solenoid valve 87 is operated by pulses from a control unit 90 at a duty ratio determined therein so as to provide control to drain the oil for providing a control pressure. The control pressure is applied to an end of a spool of the clutch control valve 82 to control the oil supplied to the clutch 60 so as to control the clutch pressure (torque). The control unit 90 is supplied with an output signal from the front-wheel speed sensor 91, the rear-wheel speed sensor 92, a steering angle sensor 93 and a shift position sensor 100 for detecting a shift position of the automatic transmission 30. The control unit 90 has a slip ratio calculator 94 to which the front-wheel and rear-wheel speeds N.sub.F and N.sub.R are applied. Since the standard torque distribution is determined in accordance with the principle of T.sub.F <T.sub.R, the rear wheels slip first. A slip ratio S is calculated in accordance with the ratio of the front-wheel speed N.sub.F to the rear-wheel speed N.sub.R, S=N.sub.F /N.sub.R (S>0). The slip ratio S, a steering angle .psi., and a shift position signal from the sensors 93 and 100 are applied to a clutch pressure setting section 95. In accordance with input signals, the clutch pressure setting section 95 retrieves a clutch pressure Pc from a clutch pressure look up table 96. FIG. 5 shows clutch pressures stored in the look up table 96. When the slip ratio S is S>1, which means that the rear wheels do not slip, the clutch pressure Pc is set to a small value. When the rear wheels slip and the slip ratio S becomes S<1, the clutch pressure Pc (clutch torque) increases with a decrease of the slip ratio S. When the slip ratio S becomes smaller than a set values SI, the clutch pressure Pc is set to a maximum value Pcmax. Further, when the steering angle .psi. increases, the clutch pressure Pc is decreased, thereby preventing the tight corner braking phenomena. The clutch pressure Pc is applied to duty ratio providing section 97 where a duty ratio D corresponding to the derived clutch pressure Pc is provided. A duty ratio D provided at the section 97 is applied to the solenoid operated duty control valve 87. FIG. 7 is a flowchart showing the operation of the control unit 90. As aforementioned, the front-wheel speed N.sub.F and the rear-wheel speed N.sub.R are detected and slipping of front wheels and rear wheels is calculated. If the slip ratio is smaller than the set value, a differential operation restricting clutch torque (pressure Pcmax) is derived from the look up table 96 in accordance with the throttle opening degree, the vehicle speed, the shift position and the steering angle. The duty ratio corresponding to the derived clutch torque is applied to the solenoid operated valve 87. When the slip ratio is larger than the set value, a clutch torque is derived from the look up table 96 for operating the valve 87 at slipping. Describing the operation of the system the power of the engine 10 is transmitted through the torque converter 13 and the input shaft 14 to the transmission 30 at which the transmission ratio is automatically controlled. The output of the transmission is transmitted to the first sun gear 51 of the central differential 50. The front torque T.sub.F and the rear torque T.sub.R are determined in accordance with the radii of gears of the central differential 50. The torque is transmitted to the reduction gear 17 through the carrier 57 at a ratio of 38% for example and to the second sun gear 53 at the ratio of 62%. If a no slip state is detected in the control unit 90 while the vehicle is driven on the dry road, a signal corresponding to the duty ratio of 100% is applied from the duty ratio providing section 97 to the solenoid operated duty control valve 87. Thus, the clutch control pressure becomes zero and the clutch control valve 82 operates to close the passage 81a, thereby draining the oil from the clutch 60. The clutch 60 is disengaged and the clutch torque becomes zero so as to render the central differential 50 free. Accordingly, the torque of the reduction gear 17 is transmitted to the front wheels through the reduction gear 18, the front drive shaft 16 and the front differential 19 at the ratio of 38%. Therefore the 62% torque at distribution ratio is transmitted to rear wheels through the second sun gear 53, the rear drive shaft 20, the propeller shaft 21 and the rear differential 22. This, a full-time four-wheel driving is established. At the standard torque distribution ratio, the vehicle is driven under the understeer condition, so that good operability is ensured. Further, the vehicle smoothly negotiates a sharp corner due to the differential operation of the central differential 50. If the vehicle is driven on a slippery road, the rear wheels slip first because the larger amount of torque is distributed to the rear wheels. The slip ratio S1 is calculated at the slip ratio calculator 94 of the control unit 90. A duty signal corresponding to clutch pressure Pc.sub.1 in accordance with the slip ratio S.sub.1 (S<1) is applied to the solenoid operated valve 87. The clutch control valve 82 is operated by the control pressure of oil obtained by regulating the line pressure at the solenoid operated valve 87, so that the clutch 60 is engaged at the clutch pressure Pc.sub.1. Consequently, a clutch torque Tc is produced in the clutch 60. The clutch 60 is provided in parallel with the carrier 57 and the second sun gear 53 of the central differential 50. Accordingly, the clutch torque Tc is transmitted from the second sun gear 53 to the carrier 57 to increase the torque to the front wheels. Thus, the distribution ratio of the front torque and the rear torque T.sub.F :T.sub.R becomes T.sub.F1 :T.sub.R1, respectively, as shown in FIG. 6a. To the contrary, the torque to the rear wheels is reduced to eliminate slipping, thereby improving driveability to ensure good operability and safe driving. When the slip ratio S becomes smaller than the set value SI, the differential operation restricting torque becomes maximum by the pressure of oil in the clutch 60. Thus, the carrier 57 is directly engaged the second sun gear 53 to lock the central differential. Thus, the four-wheel driving is established in with the torque distribution corresponding to the axle loads of the front and the rear wheels. Thus, the torque distribution is continuously controlled in accordance with the slipping condition for preventing the wheels from slipping. When the vehicle makes a turn, the clutch torque of the clutch 60 is decreased in accordance with the steering angle .psi., so that the differential limit operation of the central differential 50 is decreased to sufficiently absorb the rotating difference in speeds of the front and rear wheels, thereby preventing the tight corner braking and ensuring good operability. FIG. 8a shows another example of the central differential. The fluid operated multiple-disk clutch 60 is disposed between the reduction gear 17 and the output shaft 15 of the transmission. Thus, a bypass system 101 comprising the clutch 60 is provided for the transmitting system from the output shaft 15 to the front drive shaft 16 and to the rear drive shaft 20 through the central differential 50. When the rear wheels slip the speed difference in the central differential becomes as follows: rear-wheel speed N.sub.R >speed of output shaft 15>front-wheel speed N.sub.F. A part of the output torque of the shaft 15 is directly transmitted to the reduction gear in accordance with the clutch torque Tc. The remaining torque is transmitted to the rear drive shaft 20 from the first sun gear 51 through the first and second pinions 52 and 54 and the second sun gear 53. The front-wheel torque T.sub.F and the rear-wheel torque T.sub.R are as follows. Since the clutch torque Tc is zero in the no slip state, the torque distribution ratio of the front and the rear wheels is T.sub.F :T.sub.R =38:62. When the rear wheels slip to produce clutch torque Tc, the input torque Ti to the clutch torque Tc is directly transmitted to the front wheels. The input torque Ti transmitted to the front wheels becomes large in accordance with the clutch torque Tc. In the central differential of FIG. 8b the output shaft 15 extends through the second sun gear 53. The multiple-disk clutch 60 is disposed between the second sun gear 53 and the output shaft 15. Thus, a bypass system 101a comprising the second sun gear 53, the second pinion 54, the carrier connecting members 55, and the reduction gear 17 is provided for the output shaft 15. The front-wheel torque T.sub.F and the rear-wheel torque T.sub.R are as follows When the rear wheels slip, the torque corresponding to the sum of the clutch torque Tc and the input torque Ti is transmitted to the front wheels. The system of the present invention can be employed in a four-wheel drive motor vehicle of other types such as the type of the rear drive with a front engine. The reduction gear 17 may be replaced with sprocket wheels and chains. In accordance with the present invention, the central differential comprises two pairs of the sun gears and the planetary pinions and the carrier. The standard torque distribution to the front wheels and the rear wheels is determined by the radii of the pitch circles of the gears and the pinions. Thus, the standard torque distribution ratio can be set to various values. Accordingly, the system may be made to distribute larger torque to the rear wheels than that to the front wheels, without changing the size of the system. Since large torque is transmitted to the rear wheels, a wide range of controlling the torque distribution can be performed. Thus, operability and driveability of the vehicle are accurately and properly attained, thereby improving efficiencies thereof. While the presently preferred embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described, it is to be understood that these disclosures are for the purpose of illustration and that various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims. * * * * *",

Description BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a power transmission system for a motor vehicle, and more particularly to a differential operation restricting (a limited slip) system with a hydraulically-operated multiple-disk friction clutch in which hydraulic pressure applied to the clutch is controlled for variably changing transmission torque to right and a left driving wheels in accordance with driving conditions of the motor vehicle and the surface conditions of the road. Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 62-143719 discloses a system in which a hydraulically operated multiple-disk friction clutch is provided between a differential case and a side gear of a differential for producing torque to restrict differential operations. Hydraulic pressure for the clutch is controlled for changing the bias ratio of a limited slip differential so as to improve the steerability of the motor vehicle. The same lubricant for the multiple-disk friction clutch as that of an automatic transmission is used for actuating and lubricating the clutch, since hydraulic fluid has a good friction characteristic and a low oil viscosity. On the other hand, a final reduction gear in a differential housing provided on the outside of the differential case is composed of a hypoid gear. In such a differential, an extreme pressure agent is provided which contains additives to improve the ability to adhere to the surfaces of metals under high bearing pressures. A lubricant is subject to cause the multiple disks of the clutch to stick and to slip because of unstable friction characteristics, which causes unpleasant vibration and noise in the vehicle body. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An object of the present invention is to provide a limited slip differential system which may prevent the multiple disks of the fluid operated multiple-disk friction clutch from sticking and slipping. Another object of the invention is to provide a system which may improve control of the accuracy of the actuating hydraulic pressure applied to the clutch. The other objects and features of this invention will become understood from the following description with reference to the accompanying drawings.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Referring to FIG. 1, a power transmission system for a motor vehicle according to the present invention has an engine 1 at a front portion of the vehicle and a transmission 2 disposed in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle. The transmission 2 is connected to a differential device 4 for rear wheels through a propeller shaft 3. The differential device 4 comprises a bevel gear differential 9 for transmitting the power of the transmission 2 to rear drive wheels 5a and 5b through axles 14 and 15, respectively, and a fluid-operated multiple-disk friction clutch 19 for controlling the differential operation of the differential 9. Referring to FIGS. 2a and 2b, the differential device 4 is housed in a carrier 6 having an extension case 11 secured to a front end thereof. A cover 10 is secured to a rear end of the carrier 6. A drive pinion shaft 7a integral with a drive pinion 7 is rotatably mounted in the carrier 6 through a double taper roller bearing 12 and in the extension case 11 through a ball bearing 13 and connected to the propeller shaft 3. The drive pinion 7 engages with a final reduction gear 8 secured to a differential case 9a of the bevel gear differential 9 by bolts at a flange 9g thereof. Both the drive pinion 7 and the final reduction gear 8 are composed of hypoid gears. The differential 9 housed in the differential case 9a comprises a pinion shaft 9b rotatably supported in the case 9a, a pair of differential pinions 9c rotatably mounted on the pinion shaft 9b, and pair of side gears 9d and 9e meshed with the pinions 9c. The axle 14 of the left rear wheel 5a is splined to a hub of the side gear 9d and rotatably supported in a cylindrical portion 9f of the differential case 9a. The axle 15 of the right rear wheel 5b is splined to the hub of the side gear 9e and rotatably supported in a cylindrical portion 9f' integral with the case 9a. The cylindrical portions 9f and 9f' are rotatably supported in retainer bearings 16 and 17 through tapered roller bearings 18, 18, the retainer bearings 16 and 17 being secured to the carrier 6. The fluid operated multiple-disk friction clutch 19 is disposed between the differential case 9a and the side gear 9d of the rear differential 9. The clutch 19 is mounted on an inside wall of the differential case 9a of the rear differential 9. The differential case 9a is used as an outer drum 19a of the clutch 19. An inner drum 19b is splined to the hub of the side gear 9d and engaged with the inner end of the cylindrical portion 9f. A plurality of outer disks 19c are splined on an inner periphery of the outer drum 19a together with a pair of retainers 19d and 19e provided adjacent both end disks 19c, and a plurality of inner disks 19f are splined on an outer periphery of the inner drum 19b, disposed alternately with the disks 19c. A ring piston 19g is slidably engaged with an inner periphery of the cylindrical portion 9f. A piston oil chamber 19h is formed between the piston 19g and the case 9a. A centrifugal oil pressure chamber 19i is defined opposite to the oil chamber 19h. A spring 19j is disposed in the chamber 19i between the piston 19g and the retainer 19e. In the carrier 6 and the extension case 11, a space 6c is formed for storing the actuating oil of the clutch 19. An oil seal 20 is disposed between the carrier 6 and the outer periphery of the drive pinion shaft 7a. Oil seals 21 are disposed between the outer peripheries of the cylindrical portions 9f and 9f' and the retainer bearings 16 and 17, respectively. Sealings 9b' are disposed between the pinion shaft 9b and the case 9a, and a sealing 9a' is provided in the flange 9g. Since the characteristics of the oil for the clutch 19 and the rear differential 9 and the oil for lubricating the hypoid gears 7 and 8 and bearings 12 and 18, are different from each other, the oil seals 20, 21 prevent the lubricating oil from entering the space 6c. An oil pump 22 is secured to a side of the carrier 6 for supplying oil to the clutch 19 and the rear differential 9. As shown in FIG. 3, an oil reservoir 24 is provided on the underside of the carrier 6. An oil pressure control unit 23 is provided in the reservoir 24. The oil pump 22 has an electric motor 22c, an inner rotor 22a mounted on an output shaft of the motor 22c and an outer rotor 22b engaged with the inner rotor 22a. The oil pump 22 is communicated with the control unit 23 and with an oil strainer 25 of the oil reservoir 24 through oil passages (not shown). Outlets of the oil pressure control unit 23 are communicated with inlet ports 16a and 17a provided in the retainer bearings 16 and 17 through passages 16c and 17c. The inlet port 16a communicates with the oil chamber 19h of the clutch 19 through a port 16d provided in the cylindrical portion 9f of the case 9a and a spiral groove 16e formed on the outer periphery of the axle 14. The inlet port 17a communicates with the inside of the case 9a through a port 17d provided in the cylindrical portion 9f' and a spiral groove 17e formed on the outer periphery of the axle 15. A drain port 16f formed in the retainer bearing 16 communicates with the inside of the case 9a through a passage 14b and a groove 14a formed in the axle 14. The port 16f communicates with an inlet of the oil pressure control unit 23 through a drain passage 14c. A hydraulic control system for the clutch 19 is described hereinafter with reference to FIGS. a, 4b. The hydraulic control system comprises the oil pressure control unit 23 and a control unit 30. The control unit 23 has a pressure regulator valve 26, a clutch control valve 27, a solenoid operated duty control valve 29 and a pilot valve 28. Oil from the oil pump 22 is supplied to the pressure regulator valve 26 by which the pressure of oil is regulated to a predetermined value. The oil is fed to the piston chamber 19h of the transfer clutch 19 through the clutch control valve 27. The pilot valve 28 operates so as to provide a constant pilot pressure. The solenoid operated duty control valve 29 is operated by pulses from the control unit 30 at a duty ratio dependent on driving conditions of the vehicle, so that drainings of the oil from the control valve 29 provides a control pressure. The control pressure is applied to an end of the transfer control valve 27 to control the oil supplied to the clutch 19 so as to control the clutch pressure. The control unit 30 has a CPU having a memory, input interfaces, an A/D converter, an output interface and a constant voltage source. Output signals from a throttle position sensor, a steering angle sensor, a right rear wheel speed sensor, a left rear wheel speed sensor, a shift range sensor, and an acceleration sensor (G sensor) are applied to the CPU through the interfaces and the A/D converter for determining the driving conditions of the motor vehicle. An optimum duty ratio is derived from a map stored in the memory in accordance with the vehicle speed and a throttle opening degree detected by the right and left rear wheel speed sensors and the throttle position sensor, respectively, and applied to the solenoid-operated duty control valve 29 through the output interface to provide the control pressure for the clutch control valve 27. FIG. 5a shows a relationship between the duty ratio and the control pressure, and FIG. 5b shows a relationship between the differential operation restricting torque and the control pressure. The oil regulated by the regulator valve 26 is applied to the differential case 9a through the port 17a of the retainer bearing 17 for lubricating the pinions 9c and the side gears 9d, 9e of the rear differential 9 and the disks 19c and 19f of the clutch 19. Further, the oil is applied to the centrifugal oil pressure chamber 19i provided between the piston 19g and the spring 19j. The oil is drained from the differential case 9a to the oil reservoir 24 through the passage 14b in the axle 14 and the drain passage 14c. FIG. 6 is a flowchart showing the operation of the control unit 30. The left wheel speed N.sub.L and the right-wheel speed N.sub.R are detected and slipping of the left wheel and the right wheel is calculated. If the slip ratio is smaller than a set value, a limited slip differential torque is derived from a look up table in accordance with the throttle opening degree, the vehicle speed, a shift position and a steering angle. The duty ratio corresponding to the derived clutch torque is applied to the solenoid operated valve 29. When the slip ratio is larger than the set value, the clutch torque is derived from the look-up table for operating the valve 29 during slipping. Describing the operation of the system, the power of the engine 1 is transmitted to the transmission 2 by which the transmission ratio is automatically controlled. The output of the transmission 2 is transmitted to the differential device 4 through the propeller shaft 3. The power is transmitted to the rear-wheels 5a and 5b through the rear differential 9. In the system, the clutch 19 is disposed between the differential case 9a and the side gear 9d of the rear differential 9 for continuously varying the limited slip differential torque in accordance with the transmitting torque of the clutch. Namely, the differential torque is changed in accordance with the clutch pressure controlled by the duty ratio signal from the control unit 30. For example, if a duty ratio of 100% is applied to the duty control valve 29, the clutch 19 is disengaged so that the transmission torque is zero and the differential operation is not restricted. In straight ahead driving, if road resistances on the right and the left rear wheels are equal, the resistance exerted on the side gears 9d and 9e of the rear differential 9 are equal to each other. Thus, the pinions 7 do not rotate. The differential 9a, the pinion shaft 9b and the side gears 9d and 9e are integrally rotated. 50% of the torque is transmitted to the right and the left rear wheels, respectively. The vehicle can negotiate a corner with the differential operation. However, if one of the rear wheels runs on a road having a high friction coefficient such as a paved road and the other wheel runs on a road having a low friction coefficient such as a snowy road, the road resistances on the respective wheels are different from each other. If the differential case 9a rotates, the differential operation is performed because of the difference between the road resistances on the right and the left rear wheels. Consequently, the driving power is not transmitted to the wheel on the road having a high friction coefficient so that it is difficult to move the vehicle on a slippery road such as a muddy road, an off road or a snowy road. If 0% duty ratio is applied to the duty control valve 29, the clutch 19 is engaged to lock the rear differential 9. In this state, if the right and the left rear wheels of the vehicle are on the road having different friction coefficients, 50% torque is transmitted to the respective rear wheels, thereby ensuring the driving power of the wheels. In particular, if the duty ratio is increased, the transmitting torque of the clutch 19 reduces to gradually release the locking of the differential. If the limited slip differential torque is set to a moderate and small value, the proper differential operation is effected under various driving conditions of the vehicle. The differential torque is controlled within a preferable range so as to distribute the torque to the left and the right rear wheels 5a and 5b at a proper ratio in accordance with the driving conditions and the surface conditions of the road. Since the control unit 30 for the clutch 19 calculates an appropriate duty ratio in accordance with the signals from the sensors and the table for the duty ratio, it is possible to control the torque to the respective rear wheels 5a and 5b dependent on the driving conditions of the motor vehicle and the surface conditions of the road, thereby improving the driving stability, driveability and starting characteristics of the vehicle. In a vehicle having an antilock braking system on a brake system, when the antilock braking is effected, the difference of the rotating speeds between the right and the left rear wheels 5a and 5b is obtained by disengaging the clutch 19. Thus, the antilock braking is effected. Since the clutch 19 is provided with the oil having a proper characteristic, the uncomfortable repeat of disk sticking and slipping do not occur. Thus, uncomfortable oscillation and noise are prevented, and the reliability and durability of the power transmitting system are improved. When the centrifugal force of the fluid is exerted in the chamber 19h, the piston 19g urges the end disk. However, the centrifugal force of the fluid in the chamber 19i is exerted on the piston 19g. Thus, the oil pressure exerted on the piston 19g by the centrifugal force in the oil chamber 19h is cancelled (compensated), thereby ensuring the control of the clutch torque in accordance with the clutch pressure. FIGS. 7 to 11 show a second embodiment of the invention. A carrier 36 of the differential device 4 is connected to the extension case 11 in which the drive pinion shaft 7a is rotatably mounted. The final reduction gear 8 engaged with the drive pinion 7 is secured to a flange 39g of a differential case 39a by bolts. The differential case 39a of the rear differential 9 has a cylindrical portion 39f in which the axle 14 is rotatably supported and a cylindrical portion 39f' rotatably supporting the axle 15 through a bearing 39b (FIG. 9). The cylindrical portion 39f is rotatably supported in a retainer bearing 35 secured to the carrier 36 through a taper roller bearing 38. The cylindrical portion 39f' is rotatably supported in a clutch housing 37 through a taper roller bearing 38. A fluid operated multiple-disk friction clutch 40 is housed in the clutch housing 37 and mounted on the axle 15 and the cylindrical portion 39f'. The oil pump 22 is provided in an oil pump carrier 36a of the carrier 36 for supplying oil to the clutch 40. Referring to FIG. 9, the clutch 40 comprises an outer drum 40a secured to the axle 15 and an inner drum 40b splined on the cylindrical portion 39f'. A plurality of outer disks 40c are splined on the drum 40a and a plurality of inner disks 40f are splined on the drum 40b, disposed alternately with the disks 40c. A ring piston 40g is slidably mounted on an inner wall of the clutch housing 37 and on an inner guide portion 37a thereof. The ring piston 40g is engaged with a knock pin 37b mounted in the clutch casing 37 so as to prevent the piston 40g from rotating. The piston 40g engages with the outermost disk 40c through a thrust bearing 32 and with a spring 40j. A piston oil chamber 40h is defined between the piston 40g and the housing 37. When the drive drum 40a rotates, the disks 40c are rotated. However, since the piston 40g is engaged with the clutch housing 37 through the knock pin 37b, the piston 40g does not rotate. Further, the piston chamber 40h is formed by the piston 40g and the clutch housing 37 and hence it does not rotate. Accordingly, centrifugal force of the oil is not generated in the chamber 40h. Thus, the actuating pressure of the oil of the clutch 40 is accurately controlled, thereby improving control accuracy of the clutch 40. In the clutch housing 37, oil seals 41 and 42 are provided on outer peripheries of the cylindrical portion 39f' and the axle 15, respectively. Since the characteristics of the oil for the clutch 40 and the rear differential 9 of the differential and for the hypoid gears 7 and 8, the bearings 12 and 38, the are different from each other, the oil seals 41 and 42 are provided for preventing both of the oils from mixing. The oil pressure control unit 23 is communicated with the oil chamber 40h through a passage (not shown) and a port 37c of the clutch housing 37. As shown in FIG. 11, the lubricating oil is applied to the clutch housing 37 through a passage 37d and the oil is drained from the housing 37 through a drain passage 37e. The other structures are the same as in the first embodiment and the same parts thereof are identified with the same reference numerals as FIGS. 1 to 4. The hydraulic control system is controlled in the same manner as the first embodiment. Consequently, the same effect as described hereinbefore in the first embodiment. Although the system of the above described embodiment of the present invention is applied to the rear-drive vehicle with a front-mounted engine, the system of the invention can be applied to a four-wheel drive vehicle having an independent differential provided on either of the front wheels or the rear wheels, or a vehicle having a plurality of driving wheels. The oil pump and an oil pressure control unit of the clutch can be provided on the outside of the differential such as the vehicle body, the engine or the transmission system, connected by the external pipes. In accordance with the present invention, the clutch disposed between the differential case and the side gear operates to produce the torque for restricting the differential operation of the differential. The limited slip differential torque is continuously changed in accordance with the control of the clutch pressure. Thus, the differential torque is transmitted to the right and left rear wheels at a desired ratio dependent on the driving conditions of the motor vehicle and the surface conditions of the road. Therefore, the vehicle can be easily driven on slippery roads. Further, optimum driveability and driving stability of the vehicle is obtained and steerability of the vehicle is controlled. Since the clutch and the rear differential are provided in the differential carrier separated from the hypoid gears, oil having the appropriate characteristic can be used. Thus, the sticking/slipping of disks does not occur when the wheels turn around a corner. Further, the clutch contains the centrifugal oil pressure chamber 19i so that the oil pressure exerted on the piston by the centrifugal force in the piston oil chamber is cancelled (compensated), thereby ensuring the control of the clutch pressure. While the presently preferred embodiments of the present invention have been shown as described, it is to be understood that these disclosures are for the purpose of illustration and that various changes and modifications may be made without departing from scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims. * * * * *",

Description BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a torque distribution control system for a four-wheel drive motor vehicle having a central differential, and more particularly to the torque distribution control system of a vehicle with a laterally mounted engine. In a four-wheel drive motor vehicle, the torque distribution ratio between front wheels and rear wheels of the vehicle is determined to coincide with a dynamic weight ratio of the front and rear wheels, so that power of the engine is effectively used at acceleration. In the four-wheel drive motor vehicle based on a front-wheel drive with a front-mounted engine which has the static weight ratio of 60 (front):40 (rear), the ratio of the front torque T.sub.F to the front wheels and rear torque T.sub.R to the rear wheels is determined in the ratio of 50:50 which is the same as the dynamic weight ratio thereof. In the four-wheel drive motor vehicle based on a rear-wheel drive with a front-mounted engine which has the static weight ratio of 50:50, the ratio of the front torque T.sub.F and the rear torque is determined 40:60 in the same ratio as the dynamic weight ratio. Accordingly, a central differential comprising bevel gears is employed in the former vehicle in which an output torque of the engine is equally distributed, and the central differential having a simple planetary gear device is employed in the latter vehicle. The former vehicle ensures safe driving on a slippery road. If a differential lock device is provided for locking the central differential, the driving force of the vehicle is improved further. However, steering ability of the vehicle is not particularly improved. That is, when the vehicle makes a turn at high speed under the differential lock condition, all the four wheels may slip (slipping spin) at the same time, causing difficulty in driving. In order to ensure driving stability of the vehicle, the torque to the rear wheels is set to a larger value than that to the front wheels by arranging the central differential comprising the simple planetary gear device, so that the rear wheels may slip first. Thus, the vehicle can be safely driven by the front wheels at a small torque while the rear wheels idle. Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open 63-176728 discloses a four-wheel drive motor vehicle in which a central differential comprising a simple planetary gear device is provided. An output of a transmission is transmitted to a carrier of the planetary gear device. The torque is distributed to the front wheels through either a sun gear or a ring gear and to the rear wheels through the other gear. The torque to the front and rear wheels is unequally distributed at the ratio determined by the difference between the pitch circles of the sun gear and the ring gear. A fluid-operated multiple-disk friction clutch as a lock device is provided for controlling the differential operation. A standard torque distribution ratio determined by the ratio of the pitch circles can not be changed, unless the diameters of the sun gear and the ring gear change. In order to increase the standard torque distribution ratio, the diameter of the sun gear is decreased or that of the ring gear is increased. However, in a power transmitting system where an axle differential for front or rear axles and the central differential are coaxially disposed, a plurality of shafts such as axles, a front drive shaft, an input shaft connected to the transmission and a rear drive shaft are disposed so as to penetrate the sun gear. Therefore, the diameter of the sun gear cannot be decreased. On the other hand, the ring gear cannot be large because of a limitation of space and of the required gear ratio. Consequently, the power transmitting system cannot be applied to various vehicles having different static weight ratios, such as a front-wheel drive vehicle with a front-mounted engine, a rear-wheel drive vehicle with a rear-mounted and a mid-shipped engine. Moreover, since the distribution of the torque to the rear wheels can not be set to a large value, the control range of the multiple-disk friction clutch becomes small. Consequently, a motor vehicle having good driveability and steering ability can not be provided. In a four-wheel drive vehicle having a laterally mounted engine, the central differential and the fluid-operated multiple disk clutch are usually coaxially disposed with the front axle differential, as is in the prior art, thereby rendering the system compact. In addition, the same parts can be used for both transaxles of a two-drive wheel vehicle and a four-wheel drive vehicle. However, such an arrangement inevitably cannot be freely modified into variant designs. Moreover, since a large torque at the final gear is directly transmitted to the central differential, the central differential must be sufficiently rigid and durable. In addition, in a power transmission system where the engine is laterally mounted, a transfer device for changing the direction of the power train must be provided, so that the system must be arranged taking into the account of the space and the strength thereof. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An object of the present invention is to provide a torque distribution control system for a four-wheel drive motor vehicle having a laterally mounted engine, in which a standard torque ratio of the front wheels and rear wheels can be easily changed. Another object of the invention is to provide a system in which a central differential and a fluid operated multiple-disk clutch are preferably arranged with stiffness thereof. Other objects and features of this invention will become understood from the following description with reference to the accompanying drawings.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS FIGS. 1a, 1b, 2a and 2b show a power transmission system for a four-wheel drive motor vehicle to which the present invention is applied. An engine 10 is laterally mounted on the motor vehicle at a right front portion thereof. The power transmission system comprises a clutch 13 connected to the engine 10 through a crankshaft 11 and a flywheel 12 and housed in a clutch housing 1, a manual transmission 30 and a front axle differential 40 housed in a transmission case 2 and a transfer device 70, a central differential 50 and a fluid-operated multiple-disk clutch 60 housed in a transfer case 3 which is attached to the clutch housing 1 offset therefrom toward the engine 10. The transmission 30 has an input shaft 14, an output shaft 15 parallel with the input shaft 14, five pairs of change-speed gears 31 to 35 corresponding to first to fifth (overdrive) speed gears, and synchronizers 36 to 38. The synchronizers 36 to 38 are disposed between the gears 31 and 32, between the gears 33 and 34 and adjacent the gears 35, respectively. A reverse drive gear 39 mounted on the input shaft 14 meshes with a gear formed on one side of a sleeve of the synchronizer 36 through an idler gear (not shown) for reverse drive. A drive gear 16 fixedly mounted on the output shaft 15 meshes with a final gear 17 which is fixed to flanges of opposed hub members 17a by bolts (FIG. 2a) at an inner periphery of the gear 17. The hub member 17a is rotatably supported in the clutch housing 1 and the transmission case 2 through bearings 18. The front axle differential 40 is disposed inside the hub members 17a. As shown in FIGS. 2a and 2b, the bevel gear front axle differential 40 has a differential case 41 connected to a first tubular shaft 25 which is rotatably mounted on a right front axle 4R. In the differential case 41, there are provided a pinion shaft 42 secured to the differential case 41, two differential pinions 43 rotatably mounted on the pinion shaft 42 and two bevel side gears 44L, 44R meshed with pinions 42. The side gears 44L and 44R are connected to left and right front axles 4L and 4R so as to respectively transmit the output power of the transmission to the left and right front wheels 5L and 5R and to absorb the difference of speeds therebetween. The final gear 17 further meshes with a gear 20a formed on an input shaft 20 of the central differential 50. The input shaft 20 is disposed in parallel to the front axles 4L and 4R and rotatably mounted in the transmission case 2 through bearings 23. A first output shaft 22 and a transfer shaft 71 of a transfer device 70 are coaxially disposed with the input shaft 20. An end portion of the first output shaft 22 is rotatably mounted in a cylindrical portion of the input shaft 20 and the other end portion of the output shaft 22 is securely mounted in a bore of the transfer shaft 71 with splines. The transfer shaft 71 is rotatably mounted in a transfer case 3 through bearings 72. A second output shaft 21 is rotatably mounted on the first output shaft 22 through a needle bearing 24. The central differential 50 and the fluid-operated multiple-disk clutch 60 are mounted on the first output shaft 22 and hence they are disposed in parallel with the front axles 4L, 4R. The central differential 50 is a complex planetary gear device. The input shaft 20 has a sleeve 20b which is securely mounted thereon and is rotatably mounted on the first output shaft 22 through a needle bearing 24a. The central differential 50 comprises a first sun gear 51 formed on the sleeve 20b, three first planetary pinions 52 meshed with the first sun gear 51, a second sun gear 53 formed on the first output shaft 22, three second planetary pinions 54 meshed with the second sun gear 53, and a carrier 55. Referring to FIG. 3, the carrier 55 has a boss 55a, and annular flange portions 55b and 55c. Each of the flange portions 55b and 55c has three holes. Corresponding holes rotatably support a pin 56. The pinions 52 and 54 are integral with each other and rotatably mounted on the pin 56 through needle bearings 57. The boss 55a is rotatably mounted in the transmission case 2 through a bearing 58. The flange portion 55c is connected with a drive drum 61 of the clutch 60. Thus, the output torque from the output shaft 15 of the transmission 30 is transmitted to the first sun gear 51 through the drive gear 16, the final gear 17 and the input shaft 20 and further to the carrier 55 and the second sun gear 53 through the pinions 52, 54 at predetermined respective torque distribution ratios. The difference of rotating speeds between the carrier 55 and the second sun gear 53 is absorbed by rotation of the first and second planetary pinions 52 and 54. The operation of the central differential 50 for distributing the torque to the front wheels and the rear wheels will be described hereinafter with reference to FIG. 4. An input torque Ti of the first sun gear 51 and the relationship between the sun gears and the pinions are expressed as follows, respectively. where T.sub.F is the front torque transmitted from the carrier 55 to the first output shaft 21, T.sub.R is the rear torque transmitted from the second sun gear 53 to the second output shaft 21, rs.sub.1 is the radius of the pitch circle of the first sun gear 51, rp.sub.1 and rp.sub.2 are radii of pitch circles of the first and second pinions 52 and 54, respectively, and rs.sub.2 is the radius of the pitch circle of the second sun gear 53. A tangential load P on the engaging point of the first sun gear 51 and the first pinion 52 is equal to the sum of a tangential load P.sub.1 on the carrier 55 and a tangential load P.sub.2 on the engaging point of the second sun gear 53 and the second pinion 54. That is, Substituting equations (1) and (2) for the equation (3), Consequently, it will be seen that the torque distribution for the front torque T.sub.F and the rear torque T.sub.R can be set to various values by changing the radii of the pitch circles of the sun gears 51 and 53 and the pinions 52 and 54. If rs.sub.1 is 23.5 mm, rp.sub.1 is 16.5 mm, rp.sub.2 is 18.8 mm and rs.sub.2 is 21.1 mm, the front torque T.sub.F and the rear torque T.sub.R are calculated as Thus, the torque distribution ratio of the front wheels 5L, 5R and the rear wheels 9L, 9R is A large torque can be distributed to the rear wheels 9L, 9R. The clutch 60 comprises the drive drum 61 secured on the carrier 55 of the central differential 50, a driven drum 62 splined to the first output shaft 22, a plurality of disks 67a splined on the drum 61, and a plurality of disks 67b splined on the drum 62, alternately arranged. A retainer 67c is abutted on the innermost disk 67a by a snap ring 67d secured to the drum 61. A piston 64 is provided in the drum 61 and slidably mounted on a hub of the drum 61. An oil chamber 63 is formed between the piston 64 and the drum 61. A flange portion 21b of the second output shaft 21 is splined on the inner periphery of the drive drum 61 at the opening end. A gear 21a formed on the second output shaft 21 meshes with a gear 26 securely mounted on the shaft 25. The gear 26 has a large diameter and is rotatably mounted in the transfer case 3 through bearings 27. Thus, the clutch 60 is provided between the carrier 55 and the second sun gear 53 so as to change the torque distribution ratio and to lock the central differential 50. When oil is supplied to the chamber 63, the piston 64 is pushed by the pressure of the oil. The piston 64 pushes the disks 67a and 67b to engage the clutch 60 for producing a clutch torque. A cylindrical retainer 65 is disposed in a space between the piston 64 and the driven drum 62. The retainer 65 is mounted on the hub of the drum 61 and slidably engaged with an inner periphery of the piston 64. Thus, the retainer 65 is watertightly (sealingly) mounted between the drum 62 and the piston 64, thereby defining a centrifugal oil pressure chamber 66, opposite to the oil chamber 63. A return coil spring 68 is provided in the chamber 66 between the piston 64 and the retainer 65, thereby cancelling centrifugal force exerted on the piston 64 upon rotation of the drum 62. The oil for the transmission 30 is different from the oil for the clutch 60. Thus, oil seals 45 are disposed between the clutch housing 1 and the shaft 25 and between the transfer case 3 and the sleeve 20b of the input shaft 20 to separate the oil for lubricating the transmission 30 from the oil for operating the clutch 60. An oil pump 78 (FIG. 5) is provided on the transfer case 3 for supplying oil to the oil chamber 63 of the clutch 60 through an oil passage 77 formed in the transfer shaft 71 and the first output shaft 22. The oil pump 78 is driven by a motor and connected to an oil pressure control unit 76 provided in the transfer case 3 to be applied with electric pulses from a control unit 90 to control the clutch 60. The transfer shaft 71 of the transfer device 70 is connected to a rear drive shaft 75 perpendicular to the transfer shaft 71 through a pair of bevel gears 73, 74, thereby transmitting the power to the rear wheels 9L and 9R by way of the rear drive shaft 75, a propeller shaft 6, a rear differential 7 and rear axles 8L and 8R. Referring to FIG. 5 showing a control system for the clutch 60, the oil pressure control unit 76 of the control system comprises a pressure regulator valve 80, a pilot valve 84, a clutch control valve 82 and a solenoid-operated duty control valve 87. The regulator valve 80 operates to regulate the pressure of oil supplied from the oil pump 78 driven by the engine 10 to produce a predetermined line pressure and a lubricating oil pressure. An actuating pressure conduit 81 is communicated with a passage 86 through the pilot valve 84. The passage 86 is communicated with the solenoid-operated duty control valve 87 downstream of an orifice 85, and with an end port of the clutch control valve 82. The conduit 81 is communicated with the clutch control valve 82 through a passage 81a. The clutch control valve 82 is communicated with the clutch 60 through the passage 83. The solenoid-operated valve 87 is operated by pulses from a control unit 90 at a duty ratio determined therein, so as to control draining the oil to provide a control pressure. The control pressure is applied to an end of a spool of the clutch control valve 82 to control the oil supplied to the clutch 60 so as to control the clutch pressure (torque). The control unit 90 is supplied with output signals from a front-wheel speed sensor 91, a rear-wheel speed sensor 92, a steering angle sensor 93 and a shift position sensor 100 for detecting the shift position of the automatic transmission 30. As shown in FIG. 2b, the front-wheel speed sensor 91 is provided on the transfer case 3 opposite the teeth 26b formed on a hub of the gear 26 and the rear-wheel speed sensor 92 is provided opposite the bevel gear 74 formed on the rear drive shaft 75. The control unit 90 has a slip ratio calculator 94 to which the front-wheel and rear-wheel speeds N.sub.F and N.sub.R are applied. Since the standard torque distribution is determined in accordance with the principle of T.sub.F <T.sub.R, the rear wheels slip first (slipping spin). A slip ratio S is calculated in accordance with the ratio of the front-wheel speed N.sub.F to the rear-wheel speed NS.sub.R, S=N.sub.F /N.sub.R (S>0). The slip ratio S, a steering angle .psi., and a shift position signal from the sensors 93 and 100 are applied to a clutch pressure setting section 95. In accordance with the input signals, the clutch pressure setting section 95 retrieves a clutch pressure Pc from a clutch pressure look up table 96. FIG. 6 shows clutch pressures stored in the look-up table 96. When the slip ratio S is S.gtoreq.1, which means that the rear wheels 9L, 9R do not slip, the clutch pressure Pc is set to a small value. When the rear wheels slip and the slip ratio S becomes S<1, the clutch pressure Pc (clutch torque) increases with a decrease of the slip ratio S. When the slip ratio S becomes smaller than a set value SI, the clutch pressure Pc is set to a maximum Pcmax. Further, when the steering angle .psi. increases, the clutch pressure Pc is decreased, thereby preventing tight corner braking. The clutch pressure Pc is applied to a duty ratio providing section 97 where a duty ratio D corresponding to the derived clutch pressure Pc is provided. A duty signal with a duty ratio D provided at the section 97 is applied to the solenoid-operated duty control valve 87. FIG. 8 is a flowchart showing the operation of the control unit 90. As aforementioned, the front-wheel speed N.sub.F and the rear-wheel speed N.sub.R are detected and slipping of the front wheels 5L, 5R and rear wheels 9L, 9R is calculated. If the slip ratio is smaller than the set value, a differential operation restricting clutch torque is derived from a look-up table 96 in accordance with a throttle opening degree, vehicle speed, a shift position and the steering angle .psi.. The duty ratio corresponding to the derived clutch torque is applied to the solenoid-operated valve 87. When the slipping is larger than the set value, a clutch torque is derived from the look-up table 96 for operating the valve 87 at slipping. Describing the operation of the system, the power of the engine 10 is transmitted through the clutch 13 to the manual transmission 30 at which the transmission ratio is controlled. The output of the transmission is transmitted to the first sun gear 51 of the central differential 50 through the output shaft 15, the drive gear 16, the final gear 17 and the input shaft 20. Since the rotational speed is increased through the gears 17 and 20a, the input torque to the central differential 50 is reduced. The front torque T.sub.F and the rear torque T.sub.R are determined in accordance with the radii of the gears of the central differential 50. The torque is transmitted to the carrier 55 at a ratio, for example 38% and to the second sun gear 53 at a ratio, for example 62%. If no slip state is detected in the control unit 90 while the vehicle is driven on the dry road (S.gtoreq.1), a signal corresponding to the duty ratio of 100% is applied from the duty ratio providing section 97 to the solenoid-operated duty control valve 87. Thus, the clutch control pressure becomes zero and the clutch control valve 82 operates to close the passage 81a, thereby draining the oil from the clutch 60. The clutch 60 is disengaged and the clutch torque becomes zero so as to render the central differential 50 free. Accordingly, the torque of the carrier 55 is transmitted to the front wheels 5L and 5R through the drum 61 of the clutch 60, the second output shaft 21, shaft 25, front differential 40 and axles 4L and 4R at the ratio 38%. The torque at the distribution ratio of 62% is transmitted to the rear wheels 9L and 9R through the second sun gear 53, the first output shaft 22, the transfer shaft 71, the bevel gears 73 and 74, the rear drive shaft 75, the propeller shaft 6, the rear differential 7 and the rear axles 8L and 8R. Thus, a full-time four-wheel driving is established. At the standard torque distribution ratio, the vehicle is driven under the understeering condition, so that good operability of the vehicle is ensured. Further, the vehicle smoothly negotiates a sharp corner due to the differential operation of the central differential 50. If the vehicle is driven on a slippery road, the rear wheels 9L, 9R slip first because the larger amount of torque is distributed to the rear wheels 9L, 9R. The slip ratio S.sub.1 is calculated at the slip ratio calculator 94 of the control unit 90. A duty signal corresponding to clutch pressure Pc.sub.1 in accordance with the slip ratio S.sub.1 (S<1) is applied to the solenoid-operated valve 87. The clutch control valve 82 is operated by the control pressure of oil obtained by regulating the line pressure at the solenoid-operated valve 87, so that the clutch 60 is engaged at the clutch pressure. Consequently, the clutch torque Tc is produced in the clutch 60. The clutch 60 is provided in parallel with the carrier 55 and the second sun gear 53 of the central differential 50. Accordingly, the clutch torque Tc is transmitted from the second sun gear 53 to the carrier 55 to increase the torque to the front wheels. Thus, the distribution ratio of the front torque and the rear torque T.sub.F :T.sub.R becomes T.sub.F1 :T.sub.R1, respectively, as shown in FIGS. 7a and 7b. To the contrary, the torque to the rear wheels 9L, 9R is reduced to eliminate slipping, thereby improving driveability to ensure good operability and safe driving. When the slip ratio S becomes smaller than the set value SI, the differential operation restricting torque becomes maximum by the pressure of oil in the clutch 60. Thus, the carrier 55 is directly engaged with the second sun gear 53 to lock the central differential 50. Thus, the four-wheel driving is established in accordance with the torque distribution corresponding to the axle loads of the front and rear wheels. Thus, the torque distribution is continuously controlled in accordance with the slip condition for preventing the slipping of the wheels 5L, 5R, 9L, 9R. When the vehicle makes a turn, the clutch torque of the clutch 60 is decreased in accordance with the steering angle .psi., so that the differential limit operation of the central differential 50 is decreased to sufficiently absorb the speed difference between the front and rear wheels, thereby preventing tight corner braking and ensuring good operability. It will be noted that the standard torque ratio and the torque distribution ratios may be set to other values than the above-described embodiment. FIGS. 9a shows another example of the central differential. The fluid-operated multiple-disk clutch 60 is disposed between the carrier 55 and the input shaft 20 of the central differential 50. Thus, a bypass system 101 comprising the clutch 60 is provided for the transmitting system from the input shaft 20 to the first output shaft 22 and to the second output shaft 21 through the central differential 50. When the rear wheels 9L, 9R slip, the speed difference in the central differential 50 becomes: rear-wheel speed N.sub.R >speed of input shaft 20>front-wheel speed N.sub.F. A part of the input torque of the input shaft 20 is directly transmitted to the second output shaft 21 through the drive drum 61 of the clutch 60 and the carrier 55 in accordance with the clutch torque Tc. The remaining torque is transmitted to the first output shaft 22 from the first sun gear 51 through the first and second pinions 52 and 54 and the second sun gear 53. The front-wheel torque T.sub.F and the rear-wheel torque T.sub.R are as follows. Since the clutch torque Tc is zero in the no slip state, the torque distribution ratio of the front and rear wheels is T.sub.F :T.sub.R =38:62. When the rear wheels slip to produce clutch torque Tc, the input torque Ti proportional to the clutch torque Tc is directly transmitted to the front wheels 5L, 5R. The input torque Ti transmitted to the front wheels 5L, 5R becomes large with the increase of the clutch torque Tc. In the central differential of FIG. 9b, the input shaft 20 is provided with a transmitting member connected with the drum 61 of the clutch 60. The multiple-disk clutch 60 is disposed between the input shaft 20 and the first output shaft 22. Thus, the bypass system 101 comprising the clutch 60 is provided for the input shaft 20. The front-wheel torque T.sub.F and the rear-wheel torque T.sub.R are as follows. When the rear wheels 9L, 9R slip, the torque corresponding to the sum of the clutch torque Tc and the input torque Ti is transmitted to the front wheels 5L, 5R. The system of the present invention can be employed in a four-wheel drive motor vehicle of other types such as the type of the rear wheel drive vehicle with a rear engine. In accordance with the present invention, the central differential comprises two pairs of sun gears and planetary pinions and a carrier. The standard torque distribution to front wheels 5L, 5R and the rear wheels 9L, 9R is determined by the radii of the pitch circles of the gears and the pinions. Thus, the torque distribution ratio can be set to various values. Accordingly, a rigid and compact system may be made to distribute larger torque to the rear wheels 9L, 9R than that to the front wheels 5L, 5R, without changing the size of the system. Since large torque is transmitted to the rear wheels 9L, 9R, steerability is improved and the slipping of the wheels is accurately detected, thereby improving acceleration characteristics. In addition, wide controlling of the torque distribution can be performed. Thus, operability and driveability of the vehicle are accurately and properly controlled, thereby improving efficiencies thereof. Since the central differential and the fluid-operated multiple-disk clutch are coaxially provided with the transfer shaft parallel to the front axles, a large space can be provided for the differential and the clutch. Thus, the central differential and the clutch can be arbitrarily disposed and the assemblage thereof is facilitated. The fluid-operated multiple-disk clutch has a sealed construction, so that a preferable lubricant for the clutch can be used. The torque transmitted to the central differential can be decreased by increasing the speed of the input gear 20a. Accordingly, the central differential need not be extremely rigid, which enables reduction of the size thereof. While the presently preferred embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described, it is to be understood that these disclosures are for the purpose of illustration and that various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims. * * * * *",

Description BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a torque distribution control system for a four-wheel drive motor vehicle having a central differential, and more particularly to a control system in which output torque of a transmission is unequally distributed to front wheels and rear wheels in accordance with driving conditions. In a full-time four-wheel drive motor vehicle with a central differential, a fluid-operated multiple-disk friction clutch is provided for restricting the differential operation. The torque distributed to the front wheels and the rear wheels is controlled by the torque of the friction clutch, thereby improving straight-ahead stability, acceleration and driveability. In order to widely control the distribution of the torque, it is necessary for the central differential to be arranged to unequally distribute the torque to the front wheels and the rear wheels. There are two methods for the unequal distributing system. One of the methods is a front-weighed distribution which is weighed to the front wheels, and the other is a rear-weighed distribution method which is weighed to the rear wheels. In the front-wheel weighed system, larger torque is transmitted to the front wheels. Accordingly, although the vehicle has good straight-ahead stability, it is inferior in steerability because of a drifting out of the course. In the rear-wheel weighed system, the larger torque is transmitted to the rear wheels. The vehicle has good steerability and driveability on a dry road. However, the vehicle is liable to spin on a slippery road. On the other hand, a disadvantage of the four-wheel drive vehicle is that all of the four wheels may slip (slipping spin) at the same time, causing difficulty in driving. In order to ensure driving stability of the vehicle, the torque to the rear wheels is set to a larger value than that to the front wheels, so that the rear wheels may slip first. Thus, the vehicle can be safely driven by the front wheels at small torque while the rear wheels idle. Since the driving force (acceleration force) is distributed to the four wheels, each wheel can sustain a larger side force. Thus, in order to ensure driving stability in the rear-wheel weighted system, it is necessary to keep the sustainable side force of the rear wheels large. The driving force and the side force change with the slip ratio of the wheel to the ground (slip ratio is described hereinafter in detail). The slip ratio changes in accordance with the condition of the road surface and the coefficient of friction of the tire. In particular, if the slip ratio is larger than a predetermined value (10 to 20%), the driving force and the sustainable side force remarkably reduce, which results in a deterioration of driving stability. Accordingly, the slip ratio of the rear wheel is controlled so as not to exceed the predetermined value. If system operates to increase the torque distributed to the front wheels in accordance with the reduction of the sustainable side force, slipping of the rear wheels is prevented to ensure the driving force. Therefore, it is desirable to control the torque distribution based on the rear-wheel slip ratio. Japanese Patent Applications Laid-Open 62-55228, 62-261539 and 63-8026 disclose four-wheel drive control systems in which a central differential comprising a simple planetary gear device is provided. Standard torque to the front and rear wheels is unequally distributed at a ratio determined by a difference between pitch circles of gears of the planetary gear device. Torque capacity of the clutch is controlled in accordance with the difference between speeds of the front wheels and the rear wheels, or with a predetermined value corrected by vehicle speed and steering angle. However, in conventional systems, the standard torque distribution ratio determined by the ratio of the pitch circles can not be changed, unless diameters of the gears change. However, it is difficult to change the diameters because of a limitation of space. Since the distribution of torque to the rear wheels can not be set to a large value, a control range of the torque distribution becomes small. Further, the torque distribution is controlled by restricting the differential operation of the central differential. Therefore, slip conditions of the wheels on the road surface can not be detected so that it is impossible to actively control the torque distribution in accordance with the slip conditions. In addition, with a low coefficient of friction on a road surface, if the vehicle is driven under slipping conditions and the speed difference of the front wheels and the rear wheels is small, the torque distribution can not be controlled. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An object of the present invention is to provide a torque distribution control system for a four-wheel drive motor vehicle in which a large torque is distributed to rear wheels, thereby enabling control over a wide torque distribution range. Another object of the present invention is to provide a system which may ensure driveability, driving stability and steerability in accordance with slip conditions. According to the present invention, there is provided a system for controlling torque distributed to front wheels and rear wheels of a motor vehicle having a transmission, a central differential for distributing an output torque of the transmission to the front wheels and the rear wheels of the vehicle, and a restricting device for restricting the differential operation of the central differential. The system further includes the central differential being arranged to distribute a larger torque to the rear-wheels than to the front wheels, calculator means for calculating a slip ratio of the rear wheels, means for setting a restricting torque for determining restricting torque of the fluid-operated restricting device. At slipping of the front wheels, the slip ratio is calculated based on angular velocity of the front wheels before the slipping and acceleration of the vehicle. The other objects and features of this invention will become understood from the following description with reference to the accompanying drawings .

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS FIG. 1a shows a power transmission system for a four-wheel drive motor vehicle having a central differential according to the present invention. An engine 1 is mounted on a front portion of the vehicle. A clutch 2 and an automatic transmission 3 are operatively connected at the rear of the engine 1 in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle. An output of the automatic transmission 3 is transmitted to an output shaft 4 which is aligned with a central differential 20 for rearwardly transmitting the torque. The output shaft 4 is connected via the central differential 20 to a front drive shaft 5 which is disposed in parallel under the automatic transmission 3 through a pair of reduction gears 25 and 26 of the central differential 20. The front drive shaft 5 is connected to front wheels 9 through a front differential 7 and axles 8. The output shaft 4 is connected to a rear drive shaft 6 through the central differential 20. The rear drive shaft 6 is connected to rear wheels 13 through a propeller shaft 10, a rear differential 11 and axles 12. The central differential 20 is a complex planetary gear device and comprises a first sun gear 21 integrally formed on the output shaft 4, a second sun gear 22 integrally formed on the rear drive shaft 6, and a combined planet pinion 23 comprising a first planet pinion 23a meshed with the first sun gear 21, and a second planet pinion 23b meshed with the second sun gear 22, and supported on a carrier 24. The carrier 24 is connected to the reduction drive gear 25. Thus, the output torque from the output shaft 4 of the transmission 3 is transmitted to the carrier 24 and the second sun gear 22 through the first sun gear 21 and pinions 23a, 23b at predetermined respective torque distribution ratios. The difference between the rotating speeds of the carrier 24 and the second sun gear 22 is absorbed by the rotation and revolution of the first and second planet pinions 23a and 23b. In the central differential 20, the first sun gear 21 is engaged with the first planet pinion 23a and the second sun gear 22 is engaged with the second planet pinion 23b. Consequently, a standard torque distribution for a front torque T.sub.F and a rear torque T.sub.R can be set to various values by changing radii of pitch circles of the sun gears 21 and 22 and the pinions 23a and 23b. Thus, the torque distribution ratio of the front wheels 9 and the rear wheels 13 is determined, for example as A large standard torque can be distributed to the rear wheels 13. A fluid-operated multiple-disk friction clutch 27 is provided adjacent the central differential 20 for restricting differential operation of the central differential 20. The clutch 27 comprises a drive drum 27a secured to the carrier 24, and a driven drum 27b secured to the rear drive shaft 6. When a differential operation restricting clutch torque Tc is produced in the clutch 27, a part of the output torque of the second sun gear 22 is transmitted to the front wheels 9, thereby changing the distribution of the torque. The carrier 24 is coupled with the second sun gear 22 when the clutch 27 is entirely engaged, thereby locking the central differential 20. In a vehicle with a front-mounted engine, the static weight distribution of a front static weight WF and a rear static weight WR are determined for example as when the clutch is directly engaged, and the distribution ratio of the front torque and rear torque is 62:38 which is approximately equal to the weight distribution. Thus, the torque distribution is controlled in the range between the standard torque distribution weighted to the rear wheels 13 and the torque distribution at the complete engagement of the clutch in accordance with the differential operation restricting clutch torque Tc. A hydraulic circuit of a control system for the clutch 27 comprises an oil pump 30, a pressure regulator valve 31, a pilot valve 35, a clutch control valve 33 and a solenoid-operated duty control valve 38. The regulator valve 31 operates to regulate the pressure of oil supplied from the oil pump 30 driven by the engine to produce a line pressure and the line pressure is applied to line pressure conduit 32. The conduit 32 is communicated with a passage 37 through the pilot valve 35. The passage 37 is communicated with the solenoid-operated duty control valve 38 downstream of an orifice 36, and with an end of the clutch control valve 33 through a passage 39. The conduit 32 is communicated with the clutch control valve 33 through a passage 32a. The clutch control valve 33 is communicated with the clutch 27 through a passage 34. The solenoid-operated valve 38 is operated by pulses from control unit 50 at a duty ratio determined therein, thereby controlling draining of the oil to provide a control pressure. The control pressure is applied to the clutch control valve 33 to control the oil supplied to the clutch 27 so as to control the clutch pressure (torque) and hence the differential operation restricting clutch torque Tc. Describing an electronic control system, a principle for controlling the torque distribution is described hereinafter. The torque distribution is controlled by a feedback control based on the slip ratio of the rear wheels because the torque to the rear wheels is set to a value larger than that to the front wheels by arranging the central differential 20 so that the rear wheels slip first. FIG. 2a shows relationships between the driving force T or the sustainable side force F corresponding to the slip ratio S. When the slip ratio is zero, the sustainable side force F is maximum and gradually reduces as the slip ratio S increases. The driving force T increases with the slip ratio S and reduces when the slip ratio exceeds a predetermined slip ratio Sa (10 to 20%). Thus, it will be seen that if the slip ratio S is controlled in the range of S.ltoreq.Sa, a large sustainable side force F is ensured, thereby providing driving stability by rear-wheel weighted driving. The slip ratio S of the rear wheels is represented as follows with the vehicle ground speed V, the radius of the tire r, and the rear-wheel angular velocity .omega.R. If the rear-wheel slip ratio S is controlled in a linear range of S<Sa at torque distribution 3:7, the rear-wheel slip ratio S becomes small to be approximately equal to the vehicle speed. Namely, the ground speed V is where .omega.F is the front-wheel angular velocity and r is the radius of the tire. Thus, the slip ratio S of the rear wheels is represented as follows. ##EQU1## In order to prevent malfunctioning of the central differential at cornering, the range smaller than the slip ratio Sb (for example 3%) is determined as a dead zone where apparent slip ratio produced in accordance with the difference between the speed of the front wheels 9 and the speed of rear wheels 13 at a maximum steering angle is included. Thus, the control range becomes Sb<S<Sa. The slip ratio S is calculated within the control range to control the differential operation restricting clutch torque Tc as an increasing function of the slip ratio, so that a part of the torque to the rear wheels 13 is transmitted to the front wheels 9. Consequently, the sustainable side force F of the rear wheels 13 can be increased. The control unit 50 (FIG. 1b) is supplied with output signals from a front-wheel speed sensor 40 and a rear-wheel speed sensor 41. The control unit 50 has a slip ratio calculator 51 to which a front-wheel angular velocity .omega.F and a rear-wheel angular velocity .omega.R from the sensors 40 and 41 are applied. In the slip ratio calculator 51, a slip ratio S is calculated in accordance with the above-mentioned equations. The slip ratio S is applied to a differential operation restricting clutch torque setting section 52. In accordance with the input signal, the clutch torque setting section 52 retrieves the clutch torque Tc from a look-up table. FIG. 2b shows the clutch torque Tc stored in the look-up table. The clutch torque Tc is an increasing function of the slip ratio S in the control range Sb<S<Sa. The clutch torque Tc is applied to a control quantity providing section 53 where a duty ratio D corresponding to the derived clutch torque Tc is provided. A duty ratio D provided at the section 53 is applied to the solenoid-operated duty control valve 38 through a driver 54. The operation of the system will be described hereinafter with reference to the flowchart of FIG. 3 and the graphs of FIG. 4. The power of the engine 1 is transmitted to the transmission 3 through the clutch 2 at which the transmission ratio is automatically controlled. The output of the transmission is transmitted to the first sun gear 21 of the central differential 20. The front torque T.sub.F and the rear torque T.sub.R are determined in accordance with the radii of the gears of the central differential 20. The torque is transmitted to the reduction gear 25 through the carrier 24 at a ratio of 34% for example and to the second sun gear 22 at the ratio of 66%. The front-wheel angular velocity .omega.F and the rear-wheel angular velocity .omega.R are detected by the front-wheel speed sensor 40 and the rear-wheel speed sensor 41. The rear-wheel slip ratio S is calculated in the rear-wheel slip ratio calculator 51 in accordance with the rear wheel angular velocity .omega.R and with the front-wheel angular velocity .omega.F which approximates the vehicle speed. If no slip state (S.ltoreq.Sb) is detected in the control unit 50 while the vehicle is driven on the dry road having a high coefficient of friction .mu., the clutch torque Tc is determined to be zero. A signal corresponding to a large duty ratio is applied to the solenoid-operated duty control valve 38. Thus, the clutch control pressure becomes zero and the clutch control valve 33 operates to close the passage 32a, thereby draining the oil from the clutch 27. The clutch 27 is disengaged and the clutch torque Tc becomes zero so as to render the central differential 20 free. Accordingly, the torque of the reduction drive gear 25 is transmitted to the front wheels 9 through the reduction driven gear 26, the front drive shaft 5 and the front differential 7 at the ratio of 34%. The torque at the distribution ratio of 66% is transmitted to the rear wheels 13 through the second sun gear 22, the rear drive shaft 6, the propeller shaft 10 and the rear differential 11. Thus, full-time four-wheel driving is established at a point P1 of FIG. 4a. When the vehicle makes a turn, the rotating difference in the speeds of the front and the rear wheels 9, 13 is absorbed by the rotation and revolution of the first and second pinions 23a and 23b, so that the vehicle smoothly negotiates a sharp corner due to the differential operation of the central differential 20. If the vehicle is driven on a slippery road, the rear wheels 13 slip first because the larger amount of the torque is distributed to the rear wheels 13. If the calculated rear-wheel slip ratio reaches a value S2 in the control range, the driving of the rear wheels 13 is unstable. Therefore, a differential operation restricting clutch torque T2 is determined corresponding to the slip ratio S2. Consequently, the clutch torque Tc.sub.2 is produced in the clutch 27. The clutch 27 is provided in parallel with the carrier 24 and the second sun gear 22 of the central differential 20. Accordingly, the torque is transmitted from the second sun gear 22 to the carrier 24 to increase the torque to the front wheels 9. Thus, the distribution ratio of the front torque and the rear torque T.sub.F :T.sub.R becomes T.sub.F2 :T.sub.R2 at a point P2 of FIG. 4a. To the contrary, the torque to the rear wheels 13 is reduced to eliminate slipping, thereby improving driveability to ensure good operability and safe driving. When the slip ratio S becomes larger than the value Sa (S.gtoreq.Sa) and the driving is extremely unstable, the differential operation restricting torque Tc becomes maximum. Thus, the carrier 24 is directly engaged with the second sun gear 22 to lock the central differential 20. Thus, the completely coupled four-wheel driving is established in accordance with the torque ratio distribution ratio 50:50 corresponding to the axle loads of the front and the rear wheels 9, 13 at a point P3 of FIG. 4a. Thus, the torque distribution is continuously controlled in accordance with the slipping condition for preventing the wheels 9, 13 from slipping. FIG. 5 shows a second embodiment of the present invention for correcting the slip ratio in accordance with steering angle. The correction with the steering angle is based on the slip angle at cornering. When the vehicle makes a turn, the front and rear wheels 9, 13 slide in a lateral direction to produce the side force balanced with the centrifugal force. The slip ratio S calculated in the above described equation is based on a front-wheel angular velocity .omega.F instead of a ground speed V. Consequently, the slip ratio S is calculated to be smaller than the actual slip ratio because the front-wheel angular velocity .omega.F is larger than the ground speed V. Thus, it is necessary to compensate the decrease of the slip ratio S with a correcting quantity determined in accordance with a steering angle .psi. and the vehicle (ground) speed V taking account of the tight corner braking. Further, the correction may also be made with a difference .DELTA..omega. between the speed of the front wheels 9 and the speed of the rear wheels 13 as The slip ratio S of the rear wheels 13 is calculated as follows. Referring to FIG. 5a, the control unit 50 of the second embodiment is provided with a steering angle sensor 42. A steering angle .psi. is applied to a steering correcting quantity calculator 55. The front-wheel and rear-wheel angular velocities .omega.F and .omega.R are applied to a vehicle speed calculator 56 in which the ground speed V is calculated in accordance with the average of both angular velocities .omega.F, .omega.R. The vehicle speed V is applied to the steering correcting quantity calculator 55. In the calculator 55, a look-up table for the steering correcting quantity .DELTA..omega. is provided as shown in FIG. 5b. The correcting quantity .DELTA..omega. is an increasing function of the steering angle .psi.. The correcting quantity .DELTA..omega. is determined to a small value when the vehicle speed V is smaller than a predetermined value, thereby preventing the tight corner braking. The correcting quantity .DELTA..omega. is gradually reduced as the turning radius increases when the vehicle speed V is larger than the predetermined value. The correcting quantity .DELTA..omega. is derived from the look-up table in accordance with the vehicle speed V and the steering angle .psi.. The correcting quantity .DELTA..omega. is applied to the slip ratio calculator 51 where the slip ratio S is calculated in accordance with the above-mentioned equation. The operation of the system is shown in the flowchart of FIG. 5c. The rear-wheel slip ratio S is corrected in accordance with the steering correcting quantity .DELTA..omega. in dependency on the steering angle .psi. and the vehicle speed V. The corrected slip ratio S is equal to the actual slip ratio at cornering. In the control range in accordance with the slip ratio, the differential operation restricting clutch torque Tc is set to a proper value corresponding to the slip ratio. Thus, the distribution of the torque is exactly controlled. FIGS. 6a, 6b shows a third embodiment of the present invention for correcting the front-wheel angular velocity .omega.F at slipping thereof at rapid acceleration. If the measured front-wheel angular velocity .omega.F is used at slipping of the front wheels 9, the rear-wheel slip ratio S becomes smaller than the actual slip ratio because the front-wheel angular velocity .omega.F becomes higher than the ground speed V. Referring to FIG. 6a, the control unit 50 is provided with an acceleration sensor 43. A vehicle body acceleration .alpha. detected by the acceleration sensor 43 is applied to a front-wheel slipping determining section 57. The rear-wheel angular velocity .omega.R detected by the sensor 41 is applied to the rear-wheel slip ratio calculator 51. The front-wheel angular velocity .omega.F is applied to a changing rate calculator 58 where a changing rate d.omega.F/dt of the front-wheel angular velocity .omega.F is calculated. The changing rate d.omega.F/dt is applied to the front-wheel slipping determining section 57 in which the changing rate d.omega.F/dt is compared with the vehicle body acceleration .alpha.. If d.omega.F/dt>.alpha., slipping of the front wheels 9 is determined. The result of the comparison and the acceleration .alpha. are applied to a front-wheel angular velocity correcting section 59 to which the front-wheel angular velocity .omega.F is also applied. In a slipping state, a corrected front-wheel angular velocity .omega.Fa is calculated as follows, using a front-wheel angular velocity .omega.F' before the slipping, the detected acceleration .alpha., and a calculating time increment .DELTA.t. In a no slip state, the front-wheel angular velocity .omega.F is applied to the rear-wheel slip ratio calculator 51 through the section 59. The operation of the system is shown in the flowchart of FIG. 6b. At acceleration, the vehicle body acceleration .alpha. and the changing rate d.omega.F/dt of the front-wheel angular velocity .omega.F are compared. When d.omega.F/dt>.alpha., the front-wheel angular velocity .omega.F is corrected to the value corresponding to the actual vehicle speed in accordance with the angular velocity .omega.F' before the slipping and the vehicle body acceleration .alpha.. Thus, the rear-wheel slip ratio S is accurately calculated, thereby properly controlling the torque distribution. In accordance with the present invention, since large torque is transmitted to the rear wheels through the central differential, driving stability for the four-wheel drive system as well as cornering stability are improved. The rear-wheel slip ratio is calculated to determine the differential operation restricting clutch torque for controlling the torque distribution. Since a necessary minimum torque is transmitted to the front wheels for preventing slipping, stability and steerability of the vehicle are enhanced. The control range in accordance with the slip ratio is properly determined by the characteristics of the driving power and the sustainable side force. Thus, the tight corner braking is effectively prevented to ensure the driveability. The rear-wheel slip ratio is calculated in accordance with the front-wheel speed as the vehicle speed, so that the calculation is simplified and correction of various factors can be easily achieved. Since the rear-wheel slip ratio is corrected in accordance with the steering angle and the front-wheel slip rate, the accurate slip ratio is obtained corresponding to the actual driving conditions. Thus, the torque distribution is properly controlled. While the presently preferred embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described, it is to be understood that these disclosures are for the purpose of illustration and that various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims. * * * * *",

Description BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a hydraulic control system for a continuously variable belt-drive automatic transmission for a motor vehicle, and more particularly to a system for controlling a continuously variable transmission having a torque converter with a lockup clutch. A continuously variable transmission having a torque converter with a lockup clutch is known. The torque converter operates to multiply the torque of an engine, so that the vehicle can be smoothly started. After the vehicle starts, the torque converter is preferably locked up by a lockup system, thereby preventing a loss of power and improving fuel consumption. Thus, various control systems for controlling the lockup clutch have been proposed in order to effectively use such characteristics. In order to quickly engage the lockup clutch, the lockup system starts to engage the lockup clutch at an early stage where there is still a difference between speeds of the input and the output members of the clutch. Thus, the engine speed suddenly changes, thereby causing a shock. Accordingly, there has been proposed systems for reducing the shock. Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open 63-192629 discloses a system for controlling a continuously variable transmission wherein the transmission is downshifted at the lockup of the torque converter so that the rotational speed of the output member of the clutch is increased. Thus, the speed difference between the input member and the output member is decreased so that the shock at the lockup is reduced. However, when the transmission is downshifted, the drive pulley speed, that is the speed of the output member of the clutch is rapidly increased and exceeds the engine speed at the lockup. Hence the engine torque and the acceleration characteristics after the lockup largely change compared with that of before the lockup, which causes an even greater shock. Thus, it is desirable to gradually converge the drive pulley speed to the engine speed at the lockup of the torque converter so that the engine speed and the engine torque may smoothly increase. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The object of the present invention is to provide a system for controlling a continuously variable transmission where a transmission ratio is controlled to maintain a changing rate of engine speed constant so as to reduce shock which occurs when a lockup clutch is engaged. According to the present invention, there is provided a system for controlling a belt-drive continuously variable transmission for transmitting power of the engine to wheels of a vehicle, the system having a hydraulic circuit including a transmission ratio control valve, and the transmission having a torque converter with a lockup clutch, the system comprising the transmission ratio control valve provided to be operated in accordance with driving conditions of the vehicle, for controlling transmission ratio of the transmission, a control valve provided to be operated in accordance with driving conditions of the vehicle, for controlling oil supplied to the transmission ratio control valve to change the transmission ratio, a lockup control valve provided to be operated in accordance with driving conditions of the vehicle to engage the lockup clutch, deciding means for producing a lockup signal in accordance with the condition of the torque converter for engaging of the lockup clutch. Downshifting quantity is decided in dependency on speed changing rate of an input member of the transmission so that the input member speed coincides with the engine speed. In response to the lockup signal the control valve and the lockup control valve are operated downshifting the transmission by the downshift quantity and for engaging the lockup clutch so as to change the engine speed at a substantially constant rate. In an aspect of the invention, the deciding means produces the lockup signal when speed ratio of an output member of the torque converter to an input member becomes larger than a predetermined value. The other objects and features of this invention will become understood from the following description with reference to the accompanying drawings .

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS FIG. 1 shows a four-wheel drive power transmission system with a continuously variable belt-drive automatic transmission for a motor vehicle, to which the present invention is applied. An engine 1 is mounted on a motor vehicle at a front portion thereof. The power transmission system comprises a torque converter device 3, a selector device 4, a continuously variable belt-drive transmission 5, and a final reduction and differential device 6. The torque converter device 3 has a torque converter 12 with a lockup clutch 15. A drive plate 10 is fixed to a crankshaft 2 of the engine 1. A converter cover 11 is secured to the drive plate 10. The torque converter 12 comprises an impeller 12a integral with the converter cover 11 by welding, a turbine 12b connected to an input shaft 13, and a stator 12c connected to a one-way clutch 14. The lockup clutch 15 is disposed between the converter cover 11 and the torque converter 12 for making a contact with the cover 11. The selector device 4 comprises a planetary gear 16 having a pair of pinions 16d, and a sun gear 16a mounted on the input shaft 13. Pinions 16d are supported on a carrier 16b. The sun gear 16a is engaged with a ring gear 16c through pinions 16d. A forward clutch 17 is disposed between the sun gear 16a and the ring gear 16c. A reverse brake 18 is disposed between the ring gear 16c and a main case At forward driving such as a drive range (D) selection, the forward clutch 17 is engaged to lock the sun gear 16a. At reverse driving, the reverse brake 18 is engaged to lock the ring gear 16c for reversely rotating the carrier 16b. The belt-drive transmission 5 has a main shaft 20 engaged with the carrier 16b and an output shaft 23 provided in parallel with the main shaft 20. A drive pulley (primary pulley) 22 and a driven pulley (secondary pulley) 25 are mounted on the main shaft 20 and output shaft 23, respectively. A fixed conical disc 22a of the drive pulley 22 is integral with main shaft 20 and an axially movable conical disc 22b is axially slidably mounted on the main shaft 20. The movable conical disc 22b also slides in a cylinder 21 formed on the main shaft 20 to provide a servo device. A fixed conical disc 25a of the driven pulley 25 is formed on the output shaft 23 opposite the movable conical disc 22b and a movable conical disc 25b is slidably mounted on the shaft 23 opposite the disc 22a. Movable conical disc 25b has a cylindrical portion which is slidably engaged in a cylinder 24 of the output shaft 23 to form a servo device. A drive belt 26 engages with the drive pulley 22 and the driven pulley 25. The cylinder 21 of the drive pulley 22 is so designed that the pressure receiving area thereof is larger than that of the cylinder 24 of the driven pulley 25. Thus, the running diameter of the belt 26 on the pulleys is varied dependent on driving conditions. Secured to the output shaft 23 is a drive gear 27a of the final reduction device 6 which engages with an intermediate reduction gear 27 on an intermediate shaft 28. An intermediate gear 29 on the shaft 28 engages with a final reduction gear 30. The rotation of the final reduction gear 30 is transmitted to axles 32 of vehicle driving wheels 33 through a differential 31. In the transmission 5, a main oil pump 34 is provided for supplying a high pressure of oil to the transmission. The main shaft 20 has an axial passage in which a main oil pump driving shaft 35 connected to the crankshaft 2 is rotatably mounted. An auxiliary oil pump 36 for the torque converter device 3 is housed therein. An auxiliary pump drive shaft 37 is connected to the impeller 12a and is operatively connected with the converter cover 11. Referring to FIG. 2 showing a hydraulic control circuit, oil in an oil reservoir 40 is supplied to a line pressure control valve 42 through a line pressure passage 41 by the pump 34. An oil passage 43 connected to the passage 41 is communicated with the cylinder 24 of the driven pulley 25. The passage 41 is further communicated with a transmission ratio control valve 45 through a passage 44. The cylinder 21 of drive pulley 22 is applied with pressurized oil passing through the passage 41, line pressure control valve 42, passage 44, transmission ratio control valve 45, and a passage 46. A passage 47 connected to the oil pump 36 is communicated with a reducing valve 48 for providing a constant reducing pressure of oil. A conduit 49 is communicated with the line pressure control valve 42, with a solenoid operated on-off valve 51 and with an accumulator 53. A conduit 50 is communicated with the transmission ratio control valve 45 and with a solenoid operated on-off valve 52. The solenoid operated valve 51 is adapted to be operated by duty signals from a control unit 80 for producing control pressure in the form of pulses. The pulsation of the control pressure is smoothed by the accumulator 53 and the control pressure is applied to the line pressure control valve 42, so that the line pressure P.sub.L is controlled in accordance with the transmission ratio i, engine torque Te, and torque multiplication rate of the torque converter. The solenoid operated valve 52 is also operated by duty signals and produces reducing pressure which is applied to the transmission ratio control valve 45 for shifting a spool of the valve 45 to an oil supply position and an oil drain position by the degree of duty ratio. Thus, the flow rate of oil supplied to or drained from the cylinder 21 of drive pulley 22 is controlled to provide optimum transmission ratio i. A passage 60 from the oil pump 36 is communicated with a regulator valve 61 for producing a predetermined low pressure of oil. The regulator valve 61 is communicated with the lockup control valve 63 through a passage 62. The lockup control valve 63 is communicated with the torque converter 12 through a passage 64 and a release side oil chamber 66 of the lockup clutch 15 through a passage 65. The lockup control valve 63 is communicated with the reducing valve 48 through passage 68 for supplying with the reducing pressure. The reducing pressure is also supplied to a solenoid operated valve 67. The solenoid operated valve 67 operates the lockup control valve 63 by duty signals from the control unit 80 to communicate the passage 62 with the passage 64 or the passage 65. When the lockup signal is not generated, the lockup control valve 63 operates to communicate the passage 62 with the passage 65 for supplying the pressure of oil to the torque converter 12 through the release side oil chamber 66. When the lockup signal is generated, the passage 62 is communicated with the passage 64 for pushing the lockup clutch 15 to the converter cover 11, which means locking of the torque converter. The passage 62 is further communicated with a selector valve 70 through a passage 69. The selector valve 70 is communicated with the forward clutch 17 through a passage 71 and with the reverse brake 18 through a passage 72. The selector valve 70 is provided for selectively connecting passages in accordance with operations of a selector lever for selecting operational ranges such as a parking range (P), reverse range (R), neutral range (N), and drive range (D). In the D range selection, the selector valve 70 operates to communicate the passage 69 with the passage 71 for supplying the pressure of oil to the forward clutch 17. In the R range selection, the passage 69 is communicated with the passage 72 for supplying the pressure of oil to the reverse brake 18. In the P, N ranges selections, oil in the forward clutch 17 and the reverse brake 18 are drained. Referring to FIGS. 3a and 3b, the system is arranged to control the transmission ratio, the lockup clutch for the torque converter, and the line pressure. In the system, an engine speed sensor 81, a drive pulley speed sensor 82, a driven pulley speed sensor 83, a throttle position sensor 84, and a shift position sensor 85 are provided. Output signals N.sub.P and N.sub.S of sensors 82, 83 are fed to an actual transmission ratio calculator 86 to produce an actual transmission ratio i in accordance with i=N.sub.P /N.sub.S. The actual transmission ratio i, output signal .theta.representing the opening degree of the throttle position sensor 84 and the output signal of the sensor 85 are fed to a desired drive pulley speed table 87 to derive a desired drive pulley speed Npd in accordance with values of the ratio i and the signal .theta.. The desired drive pulley speed Npd and the output signal N.sub.S are fed to a desired transmission ratio calculator 88 to calculate a desired transmission ratio id in accordance with id=Npd/N.sub.S. The desired transmission ratio id is fed to a desired transmission ratio changing speed calculator 89 which produces a desired transmission ratio changing speed did/dt. The speed did/dt is the amount of change of the desired transmission ratio id during a predetermined time interval. The actual transmission ratio i, desired transmission ratio id, desired transmission ratio changing speed did/dt are applied to a transmission ratio changing speed calculator 90 to produce a transmission ratio changing speed di/dt from the formula as follows. Where K1, K2 are coefficients, id-i is a controlling amount dependent on the difference between the desired and actual transmission ratios, and did/dt is a correction factor for the delay in operation of the system. The speed di/dt and actual ratio i are applied to a duty ratio table 91 to derive a duty ratio D in accordance with D=f (di/dt, i) using a table at upshift and downshift of the transmission. The duty ratio D is supplied to the solenoid operated on-off valve 52 through a driver 105. The engine speed signal Ne from the sensor 81 and the speed signal N.sub.P from the sensor 82 are applied drive pulley to a torque converter speed ratio calculator 92 to produce an actual torque converter speed ratio e between speeds of the input member and the output member in accordance with e=N.sub.P /Ne. The torque converter speed ratio e and the desired transmission ratio id are applied to a lockup deciding section 93 where the speed ratio e is compared with a reference speed ratio e.sub.s to determine whether it is in a converter operation state or in a zone to be coupled. The deciding section 93 further determines that the transmission starts to upshift when the desired ratio id is smaller than the largest transmission ratio 2.5 (id<2.5). A lockup-on signal is produced at starting of the transmission in the coupling zone, that is when e.gtoreq.e.sub.s. An engine speed changing rate calculator 94 to which the engine speed signal Ne is fed is provided to calculate an engine speed changing rate dNe/dt. The engine speed changing rate dNe/dt and the lock-up on signal are fed to a downshift quantity calculator 95. In the calculator 95, a drive pulley speed increasing quantity .DELTA.N.sub.P, which represents an estimated drive pulley speed after a predetermined period of time t0 since the lockup-on signal is fed, is calculated as follows. A downshift quantity .DELTA.id corresponding to the increasing quantity .DELTA.N.sub.P is further calculated in accordance with the following equation. The downshift quantity .DELTA.id is applied to the desired transmission ratio calculator 88 and added to the desired transmission ratio id. The engine speed changing rate dNe/dt and the lockup-on signal are further applied to a duty ratio table 96 to derive a duty ratio Dc corresponding to the changing rate. The duty ratio Dc is applied to the solenoid operated valve 67 through a driver 106. Further, the throttle position signal .theta. and the engine speed signal Ne are fed to an engine torque calculator 97, so that engine torque Te is calculated based on throttle position .theta. and engine speed Ne. The speed ratio e is applied to a torque multiplication rate table 98 when the transmitting torque is varied in accordance with the increase of the torque of the torque converter. A torque multiplication rate .alpha. is derived from a table. The engine torque Te and the torque multiplication rate .alpha. are applied to an input torque calculator 99, so that an input torque Ti is calculated by Ti=Te.multidot..alpha.. On the other hand, the actual transmission ratio i from the calculator 86 is applied to a necessary line pressure table 100 to derive a necessary line pressure P.sub.LU per unit torque. The necessary line pressure P.sub.LU and the input torque Ti are applied to a desired line pressure calculator 101 where a desired line pressure P.sub.L is calculated by P.sub.L =P.sub.LU .times.Ti. In a hydraulic circuit of the control system, oil pressure discharged from the pump and applied to the line pressure control valve 42 varies in accordance with the change of the engine speed Ne, so that a maximum line pressure P.sub.LM also varies. In order to detect the variance of the maximum line pressure P.sub.LM, the control unit is provided with a maximum line pressure table 102 to which the engine speed Ne and the actual transmission ratio i are supplied. Therefore, the maximum line pressure P.sub.LM is obtained. The desired line pressure P.sub.L and the maximum line pressure P.sub.LM are applied to a duty ratio table 103 to derive a duty ratio D.sub.L corresponding to the desired line pressure P.sub.L and the maximum line pressure P.sub.LM. The duty cycle D.sub.L is supplied to driver 104 which operates the solenoid operated on-off valve 51 at the duty ratio. Operations of the system will be described hereinafter. When the P or N range is selected at starting, oil in the forward clutch 17 and the reverse brake 18 are drained. Thus, the planetary gear 16 is released to disengage the transmission 5. At the same time, oil pumps 34 and 36 are driven by the oil pump driving shaft 35 and the converter cover 11 to supply pressurized oil to the line pressure control valve 42, regulator valve 61 and reducing valve 48. The line pressure is applied only to the cylinder 24 of the driven pulley 25 so that the drive belt 26 engages with the driven pulley 25 at a maximum running diameter to provide the largest transmission ratio (low speed stage). In this state, lockup deciding section 93 applies a lockup-off signal to the duty ratio table 96 so that the solenoid operated valve 67 is operated to apply the pressurized oil to release side chamber 66 of the lockup clutch 15. The oil is further supplied to the torque converter 12 so as to operate the converter 12. When the D range is selected, the actuating pressure is applied to the forward clutch 17 to lock the planetary gear 16, so that the input shaft 13 is engaged with the main shaft 20. Thus, the torque converter 12 operates to transmit the power of the engine to the automatic transmission 5. The power of the engine is transmitted to the output shaft 23 at the largest transmission ratio by the drive belt 26 and pulleys 22, 25 and further transmitted to axles 32 of the driving wheels 33 through the final reduction device 6. Thus, the vehicle is started. At the start of the vehicle, torque converter 12 multiplies the output torque of the engine at a small speed ratio e. The torque multiplication rate .alpha. is derived from the table 98 so as to increase the desired line pressure P.sub.L. Thus, the line pressure controlled by the line pressure control valve 42 is increased in accordance with the maximum transmission ratio and engine torque thereby transmitting the torque multiplied by the torque converter without slipping of the belt 26. After starting, when the driven pulley speed N.sub.S increases and the desired transmission ratio id calculated at the desired transmission ratio calculator 88 becomes id<2.5, the duty ratio table 91 produces the duty ratio signal D through the calculator 90. The transmission ratio control valve 45 is operated by solenoid valve 52, for controlling the pressure applied to the cylinder 21 of the drive pulley 22. Thus, the change of the transmission ratio is started. The operation shown in the flowchart of FIG. 4 is carried out thereafter. More particularly, the torque converter speed ratio e is calculated at the torque converter speed ratio calculator 92 and the engine speed changing rate dNe/dt which corresponds to the depressing degree of the accelerator pedal is calculated at the engine speed changing rate calculator 94. When the torque converter speed ratio e becomes larger than the reference speed ratio e.sub.s and the desired transmission ratio id is smaller than the largest transmission ratio, the coupling zone is determined. Thus, the lockup deciding section 93 produces the lockup-on signal. At the downshift quantity calculator 95, the drive pulley speed N.sub.P which will coincide with the engine speed Ne at the time t0 after the lockup-on signal is fed is estimated and the drive pulley speed increasing quantity .DELTA.N.sub.P based on the estimated drive pulley speed is calculated in dependency on the drive pulley speed N.sub.P. The downshift quantity .DELTA.id corresponding to the drive pulley speed increasing quantity .DELTA.N.sub.P is calculated so that the desired transmission ratio id is corrected to downshift the transmission. Meanwhile the duty ratio Dc corresponding to the engine speed changing rate dNe/dt is retrieved from the duty ratio table 96 and applied to the solenoid valve 67. Hence the lockup control valve 68 is smoothly operated to gradually engaged the clutch 15. In order to engage the lockup clutch 15, the lockup control valve 63 is operated to drain the oil in the release side chamber 66 through the passage 65 so that lockup clutch 15 is pushed by the oil pressure in the torque converter 12. Thus, the lockup clutch 15 comes in contact with the converter cover 11 to lock the crankshaft 2 and the lockup clutch 15, which means locking of the torque converter 12. Therefore, the engine power can be efficiently transmitted to the input shaft 13 through the lockup clutch 15. The present invention may be modified to operate the lockup clutch 15 in accordance with the vehicle speed, engine speed Ne, transmission ratio or the torque converter speed ratio e. Furthermore, the engine speed changing rate may be controlled in dependency on the engine torque. From the foregoing it will be understood that the present invention provides a system for controlling a continuously variable transmission having a torque converter wherein the transmission ratio and the lockup clutch are controlled to render the changing rate of the engine speed constant. Thus, the engine speed is prevented from suddenly changing at the lockup of the clutch, thereby restraining shock. The drive pulley speed of the continuously variable transmission gradually converges to the engine speed so that the difference between acceleration characteristics before and after the lockup of the clutch is reduced so that the clutch is smoothly coupled. While the presently preferred embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described, it is to be understood that these disclosures are for the purpose of illustration and that various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims. * * * * *",

Description BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a central differential for a four-wheel drive motor vehicle, and more particularly to the structure of the central differential. In a four-wheel drive motor vehicle, a theoretical torque split of the front wheels and rear wheels of the vehicle is determined in accordance with a dynamic weight distribution of the front and rear wheels, considering the movement of the center of gravity of the vehicle at acceleration so that the power of the engine may be used most effectively. In the four-wheel drive vehicle with a front-mounted engine, which was developed from a front-wheel front-drive type, the ratio of front torque T.sub.F to the front wheels and rear torque T.sub.R to the rear wheels are in the ratio of 50:50. In the four-wheel drive vehicle with a front-mounted engine, which was developed from a front-wheel rear-drive type, the front torque T.sub.F and the rear torque T.sub.R are in the ratio of 40:60. The central differential comprising bevel gears is employed in the former system in which the output torque of the engine is equally distributed, and the central differential having a simple planetary gear device is employed in the latter system. The former system ensures safe driving on a slippery road. If a differential lock device is provided for locking the central differential, the driveability of the vehicle is improved further. However, when the vehicle makes a turn at high speed under the differential lock condition, all of the four wheels may slip (slipping spin) at the same time, causing difficulty in driving. In order to ensure driving stability of the vehicle, the torque to the rear wheels is set to a value larger than that to the front wheels by arranging the central differential comprising the simple planetary gear device, so that the rear wheels may slip first. Thus, cornering performance is improved by the front wheels at a small torque while the rear wheels idle. Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open 63-176728 discloses a four-wheel drive motor vehicle in which a central differential comprising a simple planetary gear device is provided. The output of a transmission is transmitted to a carrier of the planetary gear device. The torque is distributed to the front wheels through either a sun gear or a ring gear and to the rear wheels through the other gear. The torque to the front and rear wheels is unequally distributed at a ratio determined by the difference between pitch circles of a sun gear and a ring gear. A fluid operated multiple-disk friction clutch as a lock device is provided for controlling the differential operation. U.S. Pat. 4,523,495 discloses a central differential comprising a double-pinion planetary gear device for the four-wheel drive motor vehicle. In the system, a final reduction gear of a transmission is used for a carrier of the differential. The differential has three pairs of double pinions. Each pinion is rotatably mounted on a shaft secured to the carrier. One of each pair of pinions is engaged with a sun gear formed on a differential case of an axle differential for a front-wheel, and the other pinion is engaged with a sun gear for transmitting the power to the rear wheels. Meanwhile, in the four wheel drive vehicle developed from a rear-wheel drive vehicle with a front-mounted engine and in the four wheel drive vehicle developed from a front-wheel drive vehicle with a front-mounted engine, the central differential is mounted in the rear of the transmission. Consequently, the space in the vehicle is reduced by the central differential, which affects room (space) and design for mounting various equipment. Therefore, it is necessary to reduce the size of the planetary gear device of the central differential. Generally, in order to reduce the size, the diameter of the pinion is reduced. In such a case, a plurality of pinions, for example three and four, are provided for dispersing the load exerted on the teeth surfaces of the pinions. When the planetary gear device having a plurality of pinions is used, conditions of engagement of the pinions and the number of teeth of each pinion should be determined, so that the pinions may be disposed at equiangular disposition. In the simple planetary gear device, if the number of the pinions to be used is n, the number of teeth of a ring gear is Z.sub.R, and the number of teeth of a sun gear is Zs, and for evenly spaced pinions the equation is determined as follows. (m is an arbitrary integer) In the double-pinion planetary gear device, if the number of the double pinions to be used is n, and the number of teeth of two pinions are Z.sub.s1 and Z.sub.s2, respectively, and for evenly spaced pinions the equation is determined as (m is the arbitrary integer) Further, in the double-pinion planetary gear device system, the pinions of each pair are disposed adjacent each other and engaged with each other. Consequently, it is necessary for have the basic conditions of the pinions such as module, pressure angle and helix angle to coincide with each other. Accordingly, the design variation is limited by the basic conditions. In the system having the simple planetary gear device, the theoretical torque split determined by the ratio of the pitch circles can not be changed, unless the diameters of the sun gear and the ring gear change. In the double-pinion planetary gear device, the theoretical torque split can not be changed, unless the diameters of the sun gears change. However, it is difficult to change the diameters because of the limitation of space. Thus, the range of the theoretical torque split can not be widely expanded. If the number of the teeth is determined in accordance with the theoretical torque split regardless of the above described engagement conditions, pinion couples are disposed at irregular angular spaces. In the system of the double-pinion planetary gear device, the central differential is coupled with the final gear, thereby reducing the size. However, a differential lock device must be provided separately from the central differential, so that the whole system becomes large in size. Since the final gear is cantilevered to support the central differential, the final gear is subject to be tilted. This will generate noise, and a reduced durability of the gears and bearings. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An object of the present invention is to provide a torque distribution system for a four-wheel drive motor vehicle in which the design range of the theoretical torque split to the front wheels and rear wheels can be increased Another object of the invention is to provide a central differential in which the number of teeth and the mesh conditions of the planetary set are determined, thereby enabling the equiangular disposition of a plurality of pinions. Still another object of the invention is to provide the central differential which may be reduced in size, thereby improving the entire durability and reliability of the torque distribution system. Other objects and features of this invention will become understood from the following description with reference to the accompanying drawings.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS FIG. 1 shows a power transmission system in a transaxle type for a four-wheel drive motor vehicle having an engine 10 at a front portion thereof. The power transmission system has a torque converter 13 with a lockup clutch 12 mounted in a converter box 1, and a front differential 19 mounted in a differential box 2 behind the torque converter 13. A transmission case 3 housing an automatic transmission 30 is attached to the rear of the differential box 2. An oil pan 5 is attached to an underside of the transmission case 3. A crankshaft 11 of the engine 10 is operatively connected with the torque converter 13. An input shaft 14 extends from a turbine of the torque converter 13 to the automatic transmission 30. The output of the automatic transmission 30 is transmitted to an output shaft 15 which is aligned with the input shaft 14 for rearwardly transmitting the torque. The output shaft 15 is connected to a front drive shaft 16 which is disposed in parallely under the automatic transmission 30 through a pair of reduction gears 17 and 18 of a central differential 50 housed in a transfer case 4. The front drive shaft 16 is connected to front wheels (not shown) of the vehicle through a front differential 19. The output shaft 15 is connected to a rear drive shaft 20 through the central differential 50. The rear drive shaft 20 is connected to rear wheels (not shown) of the vehicle through a propeller shaft 21 and a rear differential 22. A fluid operated multiple-disk friction clutch 60 is provided in the central differential 50. The automatic transmission 30 comprises two sets of single planetary gears consisting of a front planetary gear 31 and a rear planetary gear 32 for providing four forward speeds and one reverse speed. The automatic transmission has a high clutch 33, a reverse clutch 34, a brake band 35, a forward clutch 36, an overrunning clutch 37, a low and reverse clutch 38, and one-way clutches 39 and 40. An oil pump 41 is provided in the front end of the transmission case 3. A pump drive shaft 42 is connected to an impeller 13a of the torque converter 13 and is operatively connected with a rotor of the oil pump 41. In the oil pan 5, a control valve body 43 is provided for hydraulically actuating the respective clutches and brake of the transmission 30. Referring to FIG. 2 showing the central differential 50, an end of the rear drive shaft 20 is rotatably mounted on the output shaft 15 through a pair of needle bearings 23 and a thrust bearing 24. The reduction gear 17 is rotatably mounted on the output shaft 15 through a needle bearing 23a and a thrust bearing 24a. A planetary gear device of the central differential 50 is disposed between the output shaft 15, reduction gear 17 and rear drive shaft 20. The central differential 50 is a complex planetary gear device which comprises a first sun gear 51 formed on the output shaft 15, a first planetary pinion 52 meshed with the first sun gear 51, a second sun gear 53 formed on the rear drive shaft 20, a second planetary pinion 54 meshed with the second sun gear 53, and a carrier 55. The first and second planetary pinions 52 and 54 are integral with each other to form a pinion set and supported on a shaft 56 through needle bearings 26. The shaft 56 is secured to the gear 17 and the carrier 55. A boss of the reduction gear 17 is supported in the transmission case 3 through a bearing 25. The carrier 55 has a boss 55c which is rotatably mounted on the rear drive shaft 20 through a bearing 25a. Thus, the output torque from the output shaft 15 of the transmission 30 is transmitted to the carrier 55 and the second sun gear 53 through the first sun gear 51 and pinions 52, 54 at predetermined respective torque distribution ratios. The difference between the rotating speeds of the carrier 55 and the second sun gear 53 is absorbed by the rotation and revolution of the first and second planetary pinions 52 and 54. In the central differential, three pinion sets are provided as described hereinafter. The operation of the central differential 50 for distributing the torque to the front wheels and the rear wheels will be described hereinafter with reference to FIG. 4a. Input torque Ti of the first sun gear 51 and the relationship between the sun gears and the pinions are expressed as follows, respectively. where T.sub.F is a front torque transmitted from the carrier 55 to the front drive shaft 16, T.sub.R is a rear torque transmitted from the second sun gear 53 to the rear drive shaft 20, rs.sub.1 is a pitch circle radius of the first sun gear 51, rp.sub.1 and rp.sub.2 are the pitch circle radii of the first and second pinions 52 and 54, respectively, and rs.sub.2 is the radius of the pitch circle of the second sun gear 53. A tangential load P on the engaging point of the first sun gear 51 and the first pinion 52 is equal to the sum of a tangential load P.sub.1 on the carrier 55 and a tangential load P.sub.2 on the engaging point of the second sun gear 53 and the second pinion 54. That is, Substituting equations (1) and (2) for the equation (3), Consequently, it will be seen that a theoretical torque split to the front torque T.sub.F and the rear torque T.sub.R can be set to various values by changing the radii of the pitch circles of the sun gears 51 and 53 and the pinions 52 and 54. The engagement conditions for equiangularly disposing a plurality of pinions will be described with reference to FIGS. 4b and 4c. Referring to FIG. 4b, if the first sun gear 51 is fixed and the first and second pinions 52 and 54 are revolved at an angle .theta. in the clockwise direction from a standard line S, the second sun gear 53 is rotated by an angle .alpha. in a counterclockwise direction. The angle .theta. is expressed as follows. If the number of teeth of the first sun gear 51 is Zs.sub.1, the number of the teeth of the second sun gear 53 is Zs.sub.2, the number of the teeth of the first pinion 52 is Zp.sub.1, and the number of the teeth of the second pinion 54 is Zp.sub.2, the equation (5) is substituted as follows in accordance with the numbers of teeth. If the second sun gear 53 is rotated by a circular pitch angle 360/Zs.sub.2 from the standard line, the angle .theta. is represented as Referring to FIG. 4c, if the second sun gear 53 is fixed and the first and second pinions 52 and 54 are revolved by the angle .theta., the first sun gear 51 is rotated by an angle .beta. in the clockwise direction. The angle .theta. is expressed as Substituting .beta.=360/Zs.sub.1 in the equation (8), If a number N of the pinions are equiangularly disposed, the disposition angle between a first pair of the pinions and a second pair of the pinions is 360/N. It will be seen that integer times of a value is obtained by integrally multiplying the Number N with the equations (7) and (9). Consequently, for evenly spaced pinions the equation is ##EQU1## (m is an arbitrary integer) The number of the teeth of each pinion is obtained from the equation (10). If Zp.sub.1 =Zp.sub.2, the equation is simplified as follow. It will be seen that the difference between the number of teeth of the first sun gear 51 and the number of teeth of the second sun gear 53 is integrally multiplied by the number N of the pinion set of the first and second pinions 52 and 54. If the module m.sub.1 of the first pinion 52 and the module m.sub.2 of the second pinion 54 is m.sub.2 >m.sub.1 even if the number of the teeth is Zp.sub.1 =Zp.sub.2, the pitch circles become rp.sub.1 <rp.sub.2. Here, Zs.sub.1 is 24, Zp.sub.1 and Zp.sub.2 are 18, respectively, Zs.sub.2 is 15, and N is 3. If helical gears are used, and the module of each of the teeth Zs.sub.1 and Zp.sub.1 is 1.5, the module of each of the teeth Zp.sub.2 and Zs.sub.2 is 1.75 and if rs.sub.1 is 22.8 mm, rp.sub.1 is 17.1 mm, rp.sub.2 is 21.8 mm and rs.sub.2 is 18.1 mm, the equation (11) becomes Consequently, the three pinion sets, in which the first and second pinions 52 and 54 of each pair are in the same phase with each other, can be equiangularly disposed. Substituting these figures in the equations (4a) and (4b), the front torque T.sub.F and the rear torque T.sub.R are calculated as T.sub.F =0.377Ti T.sub.R =33/53Ti Thus, the torque split of the front wheels and the rear wheels is T.sub.F :T.sub.R =38:62 A large theoretical torque split can be distributed to the rear wheels. The structure of the central differential 50 and the clutch 60 will be described hereinafter with reference to FIGS. 2, 3a to 3c in detail. The carrier 55 is connected to the reduction gear 17 by three carrier connecting members 55a projected from the gear 17 as shown in FIG. 3c. Each of the connecting members 55a has a step portion 55b formed on a projected end part thereof for positioning the carrier 55. The reduction gear 17 has three holes 17a formed between the connecting members 55a. Further, the carrier 55 is integral with a drum 61 of the clutch 60. The drum 61 has a plurality of slits 61d formed in the axial direction thereof at equidistant spaces for supporting disks and a retainer of the clutch 60. The carrier 55 has three elongated slits 55e corresponding to connecting member 55a of the reduction gear 17 and three holes 55f formed between the slits 55e corresponding to the holes 17a of the reduction gear 17. The step portions 55b of the connecting members 55a are inserted into the corresponding elongated slits 55e of the carrier 55. The step portion 55b is secured to the carrier 55 (by electronic beam welding) as shown by a mark A of FIG. 3b, so that the reduction gear 17 and the carrier 55 are centered with each other. Three shafts 56 are inserted into the corresponding holes 17a and 55f, respectively. A lock pin 57 is inserted into a hole 55g formed in the carrier 55 and a hole 56a formed in the shaft 56 by press fit, so that the shaft 56 is secured to the carrier 55. Washers 58 are provided between the first pinion 52 and the reduction gear 17 and between the second pinion 54 and the carrier 55. In the central differential 50, three pinion sets of the first and second pinions 52 and 54 are equiangularly disposed between the reduction gear 17 and the carrier 55. The clutch 60 comprises the drive drum 61 secured to the carrier 55, a driven drum 62 splined on the rear drive shaft 20, a plurality of disks 64 splined on the drum 61, and a plurality of disks 65 splined on the drum 62, alternately arranged. A retainer 63 abuts innermost on the disk 65. As shown in FIG. 3d, each of the retainer 63 and the disk 64 has a plurality of engaging projections 63a and 64a formed on the outer peripheries thereof. Each of the engaging projections 63a and 64a engages with each of the axial slits 61d of the drum 61. The disk 65 has splines 65a formed on the inner periphery thereof to be splined with a hub of the drum 62. A clip 66 is provided for preventing the disks 65 from removing. A piston 67 is slidably mounted between the transfer case 4 and a boss 4a of the transfer case 4. The boss 4a is mounted on the rear drive shaft 20 through a bearing 27. An oil chamber 68 is formed between the piston 67 and the transfer case 4. A pressure plate 70 is connected to the piston 67 through a bearing 69 and engaged with the drum 61. Outer projections 70a of the pressure plate 70 are engaged with the slits 61d of the drum 61. A retainer 72 is secured to the boss 4a through a snap ring 71. A return spring 73 is provided between the retainer 72 and the piston 67. Thus, the clutch 60 is provided between the carrier 55 and the second sun gear 53 so as to change the torque distribution ratio and to lock the central differential 50. When the pressure of oil in the oil chamber 68 is zero, the return spring 73 pushes the piston 67 to disengage the clutch 60. Thus, no clutch torque is produced. When oil is supplied to the chamber 68, the piston 67 is pushed by the pressure of the oil. The pressure plate 70 pushes the disks 64 and 65 to engage the clutch 60 for producing a clutch torque. The lubricating oil is fed to an oil passage 80 formed in the output shaft 15 and to oil ports 81 communicated with the passage 80 for lubricating needle bearings 23, 23a, thrust bearings 24, 24a, sun gear 51, 53, pinions 52, 54 and disks of the clutch 60. A rear-wheel speed sensor 83 is mounted on the transfer case 4 so as to dispose a pickup adjacent to a pulse gear 82 secured to the rear drive shaft 20 for detecting rear-wheel speed. A sleeve 84 is splined with the rear drive shaft 20 and mounted in the transfer case 4 through a needle bearing 23b. An oil seal 85 is provided between the transfer case 4 and the sleeve 84. Describing the operation of the system, the power of the engine 10 is transmitted through the torque converter 13 and the input shaft 14 to the transmission 30 at which the transmission ratio is automatically controlled. The output of the transmission is transmitted to the first sun gear 51 of the central differential 50. The front torque T.sub.F and the rear torque T.sub.R are determined in accordance with the radii of the gears of the central differential 50. The torque is transmitted to the reduction gear 17 through the carrier 55 at a ratio, for example 38% and to the second sun gear 53 at the ratio, for example 62%. A slip ratio S is calculated in accordance with front-wheel speed N.sub.F, rear-wheel speed N.sub.R, and steering angle .psi.. When the slip ratio S is S.gtoreq.1, which means that the rear wheels do not slip, the clutch pressure is set to zero, thereby draining the oil in the clutch 60. The clutch 60 is disengaged and the clutch torque becomes zero so as to render the central differential 50 free. Accordingly, the torque of the reduction gear 17 is transmitted to the front wheels through the reduction gear 18, the front drive shaft 16 and the front differential 19 at the ratio 38%. The torque at the distribution ratio of 62% is transmitted to the rear wheels through the second sun gear 53, the rear drive shaft 20, the propeller shaft 21 and the rear differential 22. Thus, a full-time four-wheel driving is established. At the theoretical torque split, the vehicle is driven under an understeering condition, so that good operability is ensured. Further, when the vehicle makes a turn, the rotating difference in the speeds of the front and rear wheels is absorbed by the rotation and revolution of the first and second pinions 52 and 54, so that the vehicle smoothly negotiates a sharp corner due to the differential operation of the central differential 50. If the vehicle is driven on a slippery road, the rear wheels slip first because the larger amount of the torque is distributed to the rear wheels. The slip ratio S1 (S<1) is calculated. A clutch pressure in accordance with the slip ratio S.sub.1 is applied to the clutch 60, so that the clutch 60 is engaged at the clutch pressure. Consequently, a clutch torque Tc is produced in the clutch 60. The clutch 60 is provided in parallel with the carrier 55 and the second sun gear 53 of the central differential 50. Accordingly, the clutch torque Tc is transmitted from the second sun gear 53 to the carrier 55 to increase the torque to the front wheels. To the contrary, the torque to the rear wheels is reduced to eliminate slipping, thereby improving driveability to ensure good operability and safe driving. When the slip ratio S becomes smaller than the set value SI, the differential operation restricting torque becomes maximum by the pressure of the oil in the clutch 60. Thus, the carrier 55 is directly engaged with the second sun gear 53 to lock the central differential 50. Thus, the four-wheel driving is established in accordance with the torque distribution corresponding to the axle loads of the front and rear wheels. Thus, the torque distribution is continuously controlled in accordance with the slip condition for preventing the slipping of the wheels. In the system, the front drive shaft and the front differential can be disposed outside the transmission case. In addition, sproket wheels and chain can be used in place of the reduction gear 17. In accordance with the present invention, a plurality of the pinion sets are equiangularly disposed in the planetary gear device. Thus, the balance of mass among the pairs of the pinions are ensured during the operation, thereby improving durability of the bearings and reducing noise and vibration of the central differential. Further, since both pinions of each pair are in the same phase and a plurality of the pinion sets are equiangularly disposed by determining the number of teeth and measurements of gears, assembling and workability of the planetary gear device are improved. It is possible to simplify manufacturing of the gears and reduce the parts of the pinions. Since measurements of the gears between the first sun gear and pinion and between the second sun gear and pinion can be preferably changed, wide controlling of the torque distribution can be performed. Thus, operability and driveability of the vehicle are accurately and properly controlled, thereby improving efficiencies thereof. Each of the carrier and the shaft of the pinion is supported at both sides thereof, so that durability and reliability of the members are improved. Furthermore, a part of the fluid operated multiple-disk friction clutch is used for the central differential, thereby reducing the length of the device in the axial direction. While the presently preferred embodiment of the present invention have been shown and described, it is to be understood that this disclosure is for the purpose of illustration and that various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims. * * * * *",

Description BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a torque split control system for a four-wheel drive motor vehicle having a central differential, and more particularly to a control system which provides two or more standard torque split ratios. In a four-wheel drive motor vehicle, a torque split ratio between front and rear wheels is determined to coincide with a dynamic weight ratio of the front and rear wheels, so that power of the engine is effectively used at acceleration. In a four-wheel drive motor vehicle based on a front-wheel drive with a front-mounted engine which has a static weight ratio of 60 (front):40 (rear), the ratio of the front torque T.sub.F to the front wheels and the rear torque T.sub.R to the rear wheels is determined in the ratio of 50:50 which is the same as a dynamic weight ratio thereof. In the four-wheel drive motor vehicle based on a rear-wheel drive with the front-mounted engine which has the static weight ratio of 50:50, the ratio of the front torque T.sub.F and the rear torque T.sub.R is determined 40:60 in the same ratio as the dynamic weight ratio. Accordingly, a central differential comprising bevel gears is employed in the former vehicle in which an output torque of the engine is equally distributed, and the central differential having a simple planetary gear device is employed in the latter vehicle. The former vehicle ensures safe driving on a slippery road. If a differential lock device is provided for locking the central differential, the driving force of the vehicle is more improved. However, the steering ability of the vehicle is not particularly improved. That is, when the vehicle makes a turn at high speed under a differential lock condition, all four wheels may slip (slipping spin) at the same time, causing difficulty in driving. In order to ensure driving stability of the vehicle, the torque to the rear wheels is set to a larger value than that to the front wheels by arranging the central differential with the simple planetary gear device, so that the rear wheels may slip first. Thus, the vehicle can be safely driven by the front wheels at a small torque while a power transmission to the rear wheels occurs, causing idling thereof. Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open 63-176728 discloses a four-wheel drive motor vehicle in which a central differential comprising a simple planetary gear device is provided. An output of a transmission is transmitted to a carrier of the simple planetary gear device. The torque is split to the front wheels through either a sun gear or a ring gear and to the rear wheels through the other gear. The torque to the front and rear wheels is unequally split at the ratio determined by the difference between pitch circles of the sun gear and the ring gear. A fluid operated multiple-disk friction clutch as a lock device is provided for controlling the differential operation. A standard torque split ratio determined by the ratio of the pitch circles can not be changed, unless the diameters of the sun gear and the ring gear changes. In order to increase the standard torque split ratio, the diameter of the sun gear is decreased or that of the ring gear is increased. However, in a power transmitting system where an axle differential for front or rear axles and the central differential are coaxially disposed, a plurality of shafts such as axles, a front drive shaft, an input shaft connected to the transmission and a rear drive shaft are disposed so as to penetrate the sun gear. Therefore, the diameter of the sun gear cannot be decreased. On the other hand, the ring gear cannot be large because of the limitation of space and of the required gear ratio. Consequently, the power transmitting system cannot be applied to various vehicles having different static weight ratio, such as a four wheel drive motor vehicle based on a front-wheel drive vehicle with a front-mounted engine, and the four wheel drive motor vehicle based on a rear-wheel drive vehicle with a rear-mounted and mid-shipped engine. Moreover, since the split of torque to the rear wheels can not be set to a large value, the control range of the multiple-disk friction clutch becomes small. Consequently, a motor vehicle having good driveability and steerability can not be provided. To the contrary, it is desirable for the standard torque split ratio to be able to be freely determined without dimensional restrictions so as to transmit a sufficient torque to the rear wheels. The driveability of the vehicle such as stability, cornering performance and steering feeling changes in dependency on whether the vehicle is driven in an understeering condition or in an oversteering condition. However, when only one standard torque split ratio is provided, only one of the conditions can be set, so that it is difficult to comply with various road conditions and other driving conditions. Thus, in order to drive the vehicle in a manner appropriate to the driving conditions, it is preferable to provide a plurality of the standard torque split ratios. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An object of the present invention is to provide a torque split control system for a four-wheel drive motor vehicle, in which a standard torque ratio of the front and rear wheels can be easily selected from two or more standard torque ratios in accordance with driving conditions. Another object of the present invention is to provide a system in which a restricting operation of a central differential is controlled by a fluid operated multiple-disk clutch when the wheels of the vehicle slip. Another object of the present invention is to provide a compact torque split control system by employing a complex planetary gear device and a plurality of fluid operated multiple-disk clutches. According to the present invention, there is provided a system for controlling torque split for a four-wheel drive vehicle having a transmission, a central differential for splitting output torque of the transmission at a predetermined ratio, power trains for transmitting the split torques from output members of the central differential to the front and rear wheels of the vehicle. The central differential comprises an input sun gear operatively connected with an output shaft of the transmission, a plurality of output sun gears coaxial with the input sun gear, a carrier operatively connected to a set of driving wheels of the vehicle, a pinion member comprising a plurality of planetary pinions which are different in the number of teeth and integral with each other and rotatably supported on the carrier, each of the planetary pinions being engaged with the corresponding sun gear, and an output member operatively connected to another set of driving wheels. Selecting means is provided for selectively connecting one of the output sun gears to the output member, and a control unit is provided for operating the selecting means in accordance with driving conditions of the vehicle so as to select one of the output sun gears. In an aspect of the invention, the selecting means includes fluid operated friction clutches. The input sun gear and the selected one of the output sun gears are equal in the number of teeth and in module, and the pinion engaged with the input sun gear and the pinion engaged with the selected output sun gear are equal in the number of teeth and in module.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS FIG. 1 shows a power transmission system in a transaxle type for a four-wheel drive motor vehicle having an engine 10 at a front portion thereof. The power transmission system has a torque converter 13 with a lockup clutch 12 mounted in a converter box 1, and a front differential 19 mounted in a differential box 2 behind the torque converter 13. A transmission case 3 housing an automatic transmission 30 is attached to a rear of the differential box 2. An oil pan 5 is attached to an underside of the transmission case 3. A crankshaft 11 of the engine 10 is operatively connected with the torque converter 13. An input shaft 14 extends from a turbine of the torque converter 13 to the automatic transmission 30. An output of the automatic transmission 30 is transmitted to an output shaft 15 which is aligned with the input shaft 14 for rearwardly transmitting the torque. The output shaft 15 is connected to a front drive shaft 16 which is disposed in parallel under the automatic transmission 30 through a pair of reduction gears 17 and 18 of a central differential 50 housed in a transfer case 4. A fluid operated clutch device 70 housed in an intermediate case 6 is disposed behind the central differential 50. The front drive shaft 16 is connected to front wheels of the vehicle through a front differential 19. The output shaft 15 is connected to a rear drive shaft 20 provided in an extension case 7 through the central differential 50 and the clutch device 70. The rear drive shaft 20 is connected to rear wheels of the vehicle through a propeller shaft 21 and a rear differential 22. The automatic transmission 30 comprises two sets of single planetary gears consisting of a front planetary gear 31 and a rear planetary gear 32 for providing four forward speeds and one reverse speed. The automatic transmission has a high clutch 33, a reverse clutch 34, a brake band 35, a forward clutch 36, an overrunning clutch 37, a low and reverse clutch 38, and one-way clutches 39 and 40. An oil pump 41 is provided in a front end of the transmission case 3. A pump drive shaft 42 is connected to an impeller 13a of the torque converter 13 and is operatively connected with a rotor of the oil pump 41. In the oil pan 5, a control valve body 43 is provided for hydraulically actuating respective clutches and a brake of the transmission 30. Referring to FIGS. 2a and 2b showing the central differential 50 and the clutch device 70, a first intermediate shaft 51 is rotatably mounted in the output shaft 15 at a front portion thereof through bushes 23 and a thrust washer 24. A rear portion of the intermediate shaft 51 is rotatably mounted in the rear drive shaft 20. A second intermediate shaft 52 is rotatably mounted on the rear portion of the first intermediate shaft 51 through bushes 23a. The reduction gear 17 is rotatably mounted on the output shaft 15 through a bush 23b and a thrust bearing 25. The reduction gear 17 and the output shaft 15 are mounted in the transmission case 3 through a ball bearing 26. The central differential 50 is a complex planetary gear device and comprises a first sun gear 53 formed on the output shaft 15, a first planetary pinion 57 meshed with the first sun gear 53, a second sun gear 54 formed on the first intermediate shaft 51, a second planetary pinion 58 meshed with the second sun gear 54, a third sun gear 55 formed on the second intermediate shaft 52, a third planetary pinion 59 meshed with the third sun gear 55, and a carrier 61 secured to the reduction gear 17 through connecting members 60. The first to third planetary pinions 57 to 59 are integral with one another to form a pinion member 56. The pinion member 56 is rotatably mounted on a shaft 62 through needle bearings 28. The shaft 62 is secured to the gear 17 and the carrier 61. A boss 61a of the carrier 61 formed at the rear end thereof is rotatably mounted on the second intermediate shaft 52 through a bearing 27. The carrier 61 is rotatably supported in the transfer case 4 through a ball bearing 26a. The fluid operated clutch device 70 in the intermediate case 6 comprises first and second fluid operated multiple disk friction clutches 71 and 72 for changing the standard torque split ratios to the front and the rear wheels, and a third fluid operated multiple-disk friction clutch 73 for restricting the operation of the central differential 50. The first clutch 71 is provided between the first intermediate shaft 51 and the rear drive shaft 20, and comprises a driven drum 71a splined on a hub 20a of the rear drive shaft 20 and rotatably mounted on a boss 6a of the intermediate case 6 formed at the inner portion thereof, and a drive drum 71b splined on the first intermediate shaft 51. A plurality of driven disks 71c are splined on the driven drum 71a and a plurality of drive disks 71c' are splined on the drive drum 71b, disposed alternately with the disks 71c. A ring piston 71e is slidably mounted on the inner wall of the driven drum 71a. The piston 71e engages with the end disks 71c. An oil chamber 71d is defined between the piston 71e and the driven drum 71a. When the oil is supplied to the chamber 71d, the piston 71e is pushed by the pressure of the oil. Thus, the disks 71c and 71c' are engaged with the adjacent disks to engage the clutch 71. Thus, the output torque from the output shaft 15 of the transmission 30 is transmitted to the carrier 61 and the second sun gear 54 through the first sun gear 53 and the pinions 57, 58 at predetermined respective torque split ratios. The difference between the rotating speeds of the carrier 61 and the second sun gear 54 is absorbed by the rotation of the first and second planetary pinions 57 and 58. The torque is further transmitted to the rear drive shaft 20 through the first intermediate shaft 51 and the first clutch 71. The second clutch 72 comprises a drive drum 72a secured to the second intermediate shaft 52 and a driven drum 72b securely mounted on an inner wall of the driven drum 71a of the first clutch 71. A plurality of drive disks 72c are splined on the drive drum 72a and a plurality of driven disks 72c' are splined on the driven drum 72b, disposed alternately with the disks 72c. A ring piston 72e is slidably mounted on the second intermediate shaft 52. The piston 72e engages with the end disk 72c. An oil chamber 72d is defined between the piston 72e and the drive drum 72a. When the oil is supplied to the oil chamber 72d, the disks 72c and 72c' are engaged to engage the clutch 72, thereby coupling the second intermediate shaft 52 with the rear drive shaft 20 through driven drums 72b and 71a. Hence the output torque from the output shaft 15 of the transmission 30 is transmitted to the third sun gear 55 through the first sun gear 53 and the pinions 57 and 59 at predetermined respective torque split ratios. The difference between the rotating speeds of the carrier 61 and the third sun gear 55 is absorbed by the rotation of the first and third planetary pinions 57 and 59. The torque is further transmitted to the rear drive shaft 20 through the second intermediate shaft 52 and the second clutch 72 and the driven drum 71a of the first clutch 71. Thus, the first sun gear 53 acts as an input member, and the second and third sun gears act as output members. The third clutch 73 has a drum 73a which is secured on the boss 61a of the carrier 61 of the central differential 50, and surrounds the driven drum 71a of the first clutch 71. A plurality of disks 73c splined on the drum 73a are alternately arranged with a plurality of disks 73c' which are splined on the outer periphery of the driven drum 71a of the first clutch 71. A piston 73e is slidably mounted on an inner wall 6b of the intermediate case 6. A retainer 73g mounted on the piston 73e through a release bearing 73f is abutted on the innermost disk 73c. An oil chamber 73d is formed between the piston 73e and the intermediate case 6. When oil is supplied to the chamber 73d, the piston 73e is pushed by the pressure of the oil. The piston 73e pushes the retainer 73g which in turn pushes the disks 73c and 73c' to engage the clutch 73 for producing a clutch torque. A pair of thrust bearings 25a are provided at both ends of the second intermediate shaft 52. Thrust bearings 25b are provided between the drive drum 71b and the flange 20a of the rear drive shaft 20 and between the flange 20a and the boss 6a of the intermediate case 6. Thus, each element can be freely rotated. Oil passages 15a and 51a are formed in the output shaft 15 and the first intermediate shaft 51, respectively. Oil ports 51b and 51c are formed in the intermediate shaft 51. The lubricating oil is fed to the passage 51a from an oil passage 3a formed in the transfer case 3 through passages 15b and 15a, and further fed to bushes 23 for lubricating the bushes, the first sun gear 53 and pinions 57. An oil port 51c communicated with the passage 51a is provided for lubricating the bush 23a, thrust bearing 25a, second and third sun gears 54, 55 and pinions 58, 59. An oil passage 78 is formed in the boss 6a of the intermediate case 6 for supplying oil to the oil chamber 71d of the first clutch 71. The oil chamber 72d of the second clutch 72 is supplied with oil through an oil passage 79 formed in the intermediate case 6, rear drive shaft 20 and the first imtermediate shaft 51. The operation of the central differential 50 for splitting the torque to the front and rear wheels will be described hereinafter with reference to FIG. 3. An input torque Ti of the first sun gear 53 and the relationship between the sun gears and the pinions are expressed as follows, respectively. A tangential load P on the engaging point of the first sun gear 53 and the first pinion 57 is equal to the sum of a tangential load P.sub.1 on the carrier 61 and a tangential load P.sub.2 on the engaging point of the second sun gear 54 and the second pinion 58. The tangential load P is further equal to the sum of a tangential load P.sub.3 on the carrier 61 and a tangential load P.sub.4 on the point of the third sun gear 55 and the third pinion 59. That is, Substituting equations (1) to (3) for the equations (4) and (5), Consequently, it will be seen that the torque split for the front torque T.sub.F and the rear torque T.sub.R can be set to various values by changing the radii of the pitch circles of the sun gears 53 to 55 and the pinions 57 to 59. Furthermore, since three sets of sun gears and pinions are provided, two standard torque split ratios are obtained. If rs.sub.1 is 22.8 mm, rp.sub.1 is 17.1 mm, rp.sub.2 is 21.8 mm, rs.sub.2 is 18.1 mm, rp.sub.3 is 19.95 mm, and rs.sub.3 is 19.95 mm, the front torque T.sub.F and the rear torque T.sub.R are calculated as Thus, the standard torque split ratios of the front wheels and the rear wheels are A large torque can be distributed to the rear wheels, and particularly at the second torque split ratio, a larger torque is distributed to the rear wheels as in the rear-drive vehicle. Referring to FIGS. 4a and 4b showing a control system for the clutches 71, 72, 73, the oil pressure control unit of the control system comprises a pressure regulator valve 75, a pilot valve 83, a clutch control valve 81 and a solenoid operated duty control valve 84 for controlling the third fluid operated multiple-disk clutch 73. The regulator valve 75 operates to regulate the pressure of oil supplied from the oil pump 41 driven by the engine 10 to produce a predetermined line pressure and a lubricating oil pressure. An actuating pressure conduit 76 is communicated with a passage 85 through the pilot valve 83. The passage 85 is communicated with the solenoid operated duty control valve and with an end port of the clutch control valve 81. The conduit 76 is communicated with the clutch control valve 81 through a passage 76a. The clutch control valve 81 is communicated with the third clutch 73 through the passage 82. The solenoid operated valve 84 is operated by pulses from a control unit 90 at a duty ratio determined therein, so as to control draining the oil to provide a control pressure. The control pressure is applied to an end of a spool of the clutch control valve 81 to control the oil supplied to the clutch 73 so as to control the clutch pressure (torque). Thepassage 76a is further communicated with a changeover valve 77 through a passage 76b. The changeover valve 77 has a solenoid 77a which is energized when a manual switch 80 connected thereto is closed. The changeover valve 77 is thus operated to selectively communicate the passage 76a with the oil chamber 71d of the first clutch 71 through a passage 78 or the oil chamber 72d of the second clutch 72 through a passage 79. The control unit 90 is supplied with the output signal from a front-wheel speed sensor 91, a rear-wheel speed sensor 92 and a steering angle sensor 93. The control unit 90 has a slip ratio calculator 94 to which the front-wheel and rear-wheel speeds N.sub.F and N.sub.R are applied. Since the standard torque split is determined in accordance with the principle of T.sub.F <T.sub.R, the rear wheels slip first (slipping spin). A slip ratio S is calculated in accordance with the ratio of the front-wheel speed N.sub.F to the rear-wheel speed N.sub.R, S=N.sub.F /N.sub.R (S>0). The slip ratio S, and a steering angle .psi. from the sensor 93 are applied to a clutch pressure setting section 95. In accordance with the input signals, the clutch pressure setting section 95 retrieves a clutch pressure Pc from a clutch pressure look up table 96. When the slip ratio S is S.gtoreq.1, the clutch pressure Pc is set to a small value. When the rear wheels slip and the slip ratio S becomes S<1, the clutch pressure Pc (clutch torque) increases with a decrease of the slip ratio S. When the slip ratio S becomes smaller than a set value SI, the clutch pressure Pc is set to a maximum Pcmax. Further, when the steering angle .psi. increases, the clutch pressure Pc is decreased, thereby preventing tight corner braking. The clutch pressure Pc is applied to a duty ratio providing section 97 where a duty ratio D corresponding to the derived clutch pressure Pc is provided. A duty signal with a duty ratio D provided at the section 97 is applied to the solenoid operated duty control valve 84. Describing the operation of the system with reference to FIGS. 5a and 5b, the power of the engine 10 is transmitted through the torque converter 13 and the input shaft 14 to the transmission 30 at which the transmission ratio is automatically controlled. The output of the transmission 30 is transmitted to the first sun gear 53 of the central differential 50. In order to stably drive the vehicle on roads in general, the manual switch 80 is opened so that the changeover valve 77 is operated to communicate the passage 76b with the passage 78. The first clutch 71 is engaged, thereby to connect the second sun gear 54 of the central differential 50 with the rear drive shaft 20 through the first intermediate shaft 51 and the clutch 71. Thus, the first mode, wherein the torque is distributed in accordance with the first standard torque split ratio is selected. Namely, the standard torque split ratio is T.sub.F1 : T.sub.R1 .apprxeq.38:62, dependent on the radii of the first and second sun gears 53, 54 and the pinions 57, 58. Thus, 38% of the output torque of the transmission 30 is transmitted to the front wheels through the carrier 61, the reduction gears 17, 18, the first drive shaft 16 and the front differential 19. Meanwhile, 68% of the torque is transmitted to the rear wheels through the second sun gear 54, first intermediate shaft 51, first clutch 71, the rear drive shaft 20, the propeller shaft 21 and the rear differential 22. Thus, the four-wheel driving is established. A slip ratio S is calculated in accordance with the front wheel speed N.sub.F, the rear-wheel speed N.sub.R and the steering angle .psi.. If a no slip state is detected in the control unit 90 while the vehicle is driven on a dry road (S.gtoreq.1), a low clutch pressure Pc is set in the clutch pressure setting section 95 so that a signal corresponding to the duty ratio of 100% is applied from the duty ratio providing section 97 to the solenoid operated duty control valve 84. Thus, the clutch control pressure becomes zero and the clutch control valve 81 operates to close the passage 76a, thereby draining the oil from the third clutch 73. The clutch 73 is disengaged and the clutch torque becomes zero so as to render the central differential 50 free. Accordingly, the torque split to the front and rear wheels becomes the same as the standard split ratio T.sub.F1 : T.sub.R1 as shown at a point P.sub.1 of the graph of FIG. 5a. At the first standard torque split ratio, the vehicle is driven under the understeering condition, so that good operability of the vehicle is ensured. Further, the vehicle smoothly negotiates a sharp corner by the differential operation of the central differential 50. If the vehicle is driven on a slippery road, the rear wheels slip first because a larger amount of the torque is distributed to the rear wheels. The slip ratio S.sub.1 is calculated at the slip ratio calculator 94 of the control unit 90. A duty signal corresponding to a clutch pressure Pc.sub.1 in accordance with the slip ratio S.sub.1 (S<1) is applied to the solenoid operated valve 84. The clutch control valve 81 is operated by the control pressure of oil obtained by regulating the line pressure at the solenoid operated valve 84, so that the third clutch 73 is engaged at the clutch pressure. Consequently, the clutch torque Tc is produced in the clutch 73. The clutch 73 is provided in parallel with the carrier 61 and the second sun gear 54 of the central differential 50. Accordingly, the clutch torque Tc.sub.1 corresponding to the slip ratio S.sub.1 is transmitted from the second sun gear 54 to the carrier 61 to increase the torque to the front wheels. Thus, the split ratio of the front torque and the rear torque changes along a line l, as shown in FIGS. 5a and 5b. To the contrary, the torque to the rear wheels is reduced to eliminate slipping, thereby improving driveability to ensure good operability and safe driving. When the slip ratio S becomes smaller than the set value S.sub.1, the differential operation restricting torque becomes maximum by the pressure of oil in the third clutch 73. Thus, the carrier 61 is directly engaged with the second sun gear 54 to lock the central differential 50. Thus, the four-wheel driving is established in accordance with the torque split corresponding to the axle loads of the front and rear wheels as shown at a point P.sub.2. Thus, the torque split is continuously controlled in accordance with the slip condition for preventing the slipping of the four wheels. The manual switch 80 is closed when the vehicle is driven on a mountainous road. As a result, the solenoid 77a of the changeover valve 77 is energized, thereby operating the valve 77 to communicate the passage 76b with the passage 79. Thus, the oil is supplied to the oil chamber 72d of the second clutch 72 to engage the clutch 72 so that the third sun gear 55 is connected to the rear drive shaft 20 through the second intermediate shaft 52, the second clutch 72, and the driven drum 71a of the first clutch 71. Accordingly, the second mode, wherein the torque is distributed in accordance with the second standard torque split ratio, is selected. That is, split ratio T.sub.F2 :T.sub.R2 is 25:75 in accordance with the radii of the third sun gear 55 and the third pinions 59. The torque is mainly transmitted to the rear wheels as shown by a point P.sub.1 '. The vehicle is in an oversteering condition so that good cornering maneuverability, driveability and steerability are obtained. Although the rear wheels tend to slip in the second mode, the clutch torque Tc is produced in the third clutch 73 when the slip occurs. The clutch torque Tc transmitted to the front wheels increases along a line l' shown in FIG. 5a. Thus, the split ratio changes between the points P.sub.1 ' and P.sub.2 at which the torque is equally distributed to the four wheels. Hence the slipping of the rear wheels is restrained to obtain good running performance. FIG. 6 shows a modification of the embodiment of the torque split system. In the modification, the second sun gear 54 and the third sun gear 55 are connected to the rear drive shaft 20 through the first clutch 71 and the second clutch 72, resepctively. The system is provided with a control unit 100 which applies control signals to a first clutch control valve 77b communicated with the first clutch 71, and to a second clutch control valve 77c communicated with the second clutch 72. The control unit 100 is connected to the first, second and third switches 80a, 80b and 80c. When the first switch 80a is closed, the first clutch 71 is engaged to provide the first mode and when the second switch is closed, the second clutch 72 is engaged to provide the second mode. When the third switch 80c is closed, both clutches 71, 72 are engaged, thereby locking the central differential 50 to provide a four-wheel drive mode. Since a third clutch for restricting the differential operation of the central differential 50 is not provided, it is preferable to construct the central differential 50 so as to automatically generate a restricting torque in proportion to the input torque, thereby restricting the differential operation. In the torque split control system of the present invention, the first and second clutches serve as a power train to the rear wheels. At the time when one of the clutches is being drained whereas the other is being supplied with oil, if oil pressure is low, an accident that neither of the clutches are engaged occurs due to low oil pressure, which means the cutting of the power train. If the front wheels or the rear wheels are on a road surface having a low friction coefficient in such a state and if the accelerator pedal is depressed a lot, the torque is greatly decreased and the engine speed abnormally increases. In order to avoid such a decrease of torque, in the torque split control system of the second embodiment the present invention is provided with a hydraulic control system shown in FIGS. 7a and 7b. A changeover signal from the switch 80 is applied to the clutch pressure setting section 95 of the control unit 90 when the torque distribution ratio mode is changed. Thus, the central differential 50 is prevented from becoming neutral. More particuarly, when the switch 80 is closed to select the second torque split ratio mode, the oil in the first clutch 71 is drained so that the clutch pressure Pc.sub.1 in the first clutch 71 starts to decrease as shown in the graph of FIG. 8a. The oil is supplied to the second clutch 72 so that the clutch pressure Pc.sub.2 in the second clutch 72 starts to increase as shown in the graph of FIG. 8b. At the same time the changeover signal is fed to a clutch pressure setting section 95 of the control unit 90. The clutch pressure setting section 95 provides a high clutch pressure Pc for a predetermined period t. As a result, a predetermined clutch torque Tc corresponding to the set clutch pressure Pc is generated in the third clutch 73, thereby temporarily rendering the central differential 50 in a locked state or a slipping state. The power train is maintained for the period t, in which time, the second clutch 72 is sufficiently engaged. After the period t, the clutch pressure Pc decreases thereby releasing the third clutch 73. The control system is operated in the same manner when the switch 80 is opened to change the torque split ratio mode from the second mode to the first mode. Referring to FIG. 9 showing a hydraulic circuit of the control system of a modification of the second embodiment of the present invention, the releasing timings of the clutches are automatically retarded. The oil passage 78 connecting the changeover valve 77 with the first clutch 71 has a check valve 101a and an orifice 101b disposed in parallel with the check valve 101a. The oil passage 79 connecting the changeover valve 77 with the second clutch 72 similarly has a check valve 102a and an orifice 102b in parallel to the check valve 102a. When the changeover valve 77 is operated to connect the oil passage 76b with the passage 79, the oil is applied to the second clutch 72 passing the check valve 102a. To the contrary, the check valve 101a in the passage 78 is closed so that the oil is slowly drained through the orifice 101b. Hence as shown by the dotted line in FIG. 8a, the clutch pressure Pc.sub.1 in the first clutch 71 gradually reduces so that the clutches are maintained to provide the first mode until the second clutch 72 is fully engaged. Thus, in accordance with the second embodiment of the present invention, the central differential 50 is operated while the torque split ratios are changed so that the decrease of torque and abnormal rising of the engine speed are prevented. In particular, the system where the differential 50 is locked by the third clutch, restrains shock which occurs at the change of torque split ratio. In the third embodiment of the present invention shown in FIG. 10, the central differential 50 is so arranged that the first sun gear 53 is equal to the third sun gear 55 and the first pinion 57 is equal to the third pinion 59 in the number of the teeth, the module, and the pitch circle. Therefore, Substituting the above equations for the equations (6) to (9) hereinbefore described, Thus, a second standard torque split ratio where the torque is completely split to the rear wheels is obtained. If rs.sub.1 and rs.sub.3 are 22.8 mm, rp.sub.1 and rp.sub.3 are 17.1 mm, rp.sub.2 is 21.8 mm and rs.sub.2 is 18.1 mm, the front torque T.sub.F and the rear torque T.sub.R are calculated as Thus, the first standard torque split ratio obtained through the second sun gear 54 is Referring to FIGS. 11a and 11b, the control unit 90 of the present embodiment is provided with a changeover determining section 98 which is fed with the slip ratio S from the slip ratio calculator 94. The changeover determining section 98 applies a signal to the solenoid 77a of the changeover valve 77 in dependency on the slip ratio S. Namely, while the wheels do not slip so that the slip ratio S is larger than a predetermined reference ratio S.sub.R, the changeover valve 77 is operated to engage the second clutch 72. On the other hand, when the slip ratio S becomes smaller than the reference ratio S.sub.R, the changeover valve 77 is automatically operated to engage the first clutch 71. When the vehicle is driven on a dry road where the slipping of the wheels does not occur, the changeover determining means 98 feeds a signal to operate the solenoid 77a of the changeover valve 77 to communicate the oil passage 76b with the passage 79. The second clutch 72 is engaged so that the rear drive shaft 20 is connected to the third sun gear 55 through the second intermediate shaft 52. The second standard torque split ratio is selected as shown by a point P.sub.3 in FIG. 12a, thereby transmitting the torque only to the rear wheels through the third sun gear 55, second intermediate shaft 52, second clutch 72, the rear drive shaft 20, the propeller shaft 21 and the rear differential 22. Hence, the vehicle is driven by the rear wheels although the central differential 50 is provided. Meanwhile, the carrier 61 connected to the front wheels idles so that when the vehicle makes a turn, the carrier 61 is freely rotated. Since the vehicle is driven under the oversteering condition, maneuverability, driveability, and steerability are improved. When the rear wheels slip so that the slip ratio S becomes smaller than the reference slip ratio S.sub.R, the changeover determining section 98 applies a signal to de-energize the solenoid 77a of the changeover valve 77, thereby communicating the passages 76b and 78. Thus, the first clutch 71 is engaged so that the rear drive shaft 20 is connected with the second sun gear 54 through the first intermediate shaft 51. The first standard torque split ratio mode is hence determined, thereby transmitting the torque to the front and the rear wheels at the ratio of T.sub.F1 :T.sub.R1 .apprxeq.38:62 as shown at the point P.sub.1 in FIG. 12a. In the first standard torque split ratio mode, since the torque is distributed to the four wheels, slipping of the wheels is restrained, thereby enhancing good running performance and stable driving. If an excessive torque is transmitted when the vehicle is driven on a slippery road, the rear wheels to which a larger torque is transmitted are apt to slip so that the slip ratio S decreases. The oil is applied to the third clutch 73 so that the clutch 73 is operated to increase the torque transmitted to the front wheels in the manner described in the description of the first embodiment. Therefore, the slipping of the wheels is prevented, and the vehicle is driven in an understeering condition so that the running performance and the stability of the vehicle are improved. When the vehicle is driven on a road having an extremely low friction coefficient such as an icy road, or when stuck in mud or in sand, the slip ratio S becomes smaller than the set value S.sub.1, the clutch pressure Pc applied to the third clutch 73 becomes maximum, thereby locking the central differential 50. The four-wheel driving is established so that the running performance is enhanced. The present embodiment may be modified to manually operate the changeover valve, or in accordance with other factors besides the slip ratio S. In a vehicle having an antilock braking system on a brake system, when the antilock braking is effected, an ABS actuating signal is applied to the clutch pressure setting section 95 to render the clutch pressure Pc zero, thereby releasing the clutch 73. In the central differential 50 of the fourth embodiment of the present invention, each set of the first to third pinion has three pinions. The engagement conditions for equiangularly disposing a plurality of pinions will be described with reference to FIGS. 13a to 13c. Referring to FIG. 13a, if the first sun gear 53 is fixed and the first, second and third pinions 57, 58 and 59 are revolved an angle .theta. in the clockwise direction from a standard line SL, the second sun gear 54 is rotated by an angle .alpha..sub.1 in a counterclockwise direction and the third sun gear is rotated by an angle .beta..sub.1 in a counterclockwise direction. The angle .theta. is expressed as follows. If the number of the teeth of the first sun gear 53 is Zs.sub.1, the number of the teeth of the second sun gear 54 is Zs.sub.2, the number of the teeth of the third sun gear is Zs.sub.3, the number of the teeth of the first pinion 57 is Zp.sub.1, the number of the teeth of the second pinion 58 is Zp.sub.2, and the number of the teeth of the third pinion 59 is Zp.sub.3, the equations (10) and (11) are substituted as follows in accordance with the numbers of the teeth. If the second sun gear 54 is rotated by a circular pitch angle 360/Zs.sub.2 and the third sun gear 55 is rotated by a circular angle 360/Zs.sub.3, each from the standard line, the angle .theta. is represented as Referring to FIG. 13b, if the second sun gear 54 is fixed and the first, second and third pinions 57, 58 and 59 are revolved by the angle .theta. in the clockwise direction, the first sun gear 53 is rotated by an angle .beta..sub.2 in the clockwise direction and the third sun gear 55 is rotated by an angle .alpha..sub.2 in the clockwise direction. The angle .theta. is expressed as Substituting .beta..sub.2 =360/Zs.sub.3 and .alpha..sub.2 =360/Zs.sub.1 in the equations (16) and (17), Referring to FIG. 13c, if the third sun gear 55 is fixed and the first, second and third pinions 57, 58 and 59 are revolved by the angle .theta. in the clockwise direction, the first sun gear 53 is rotated by an angle .beta..sub.3 in the clockwise direction and the second sun gear 54 is rotated by an angle .alpha..sub.3 in the clockwise direction. The angle .theta. is expressed as Substituting .alpha..sub.3 =360/Zs.sub.2 and .beta..sub.3 =360/Zs.sub.3 in the equations (20) and (21). If a number N of the pinons are equiangularly disposed, the disposition angle between a first pair of the pinions and a second pair of the pinions is 360/N. It will be seen that integer times of a value is obtained by integrally multiplying the number N from the equations (14), (15), (18), (19), (22) and (23). Consequently, for evenly spaced pinions the equation is ##EQU2## The number of the teeth of each pinion is obtained from the equations (24), (25) and (26). If Zp.sub.1 =Zp.sub.2 =Zp.sub.3, the equations are simplified as follows. ##EQU3## It will be seen that the differences among the number of the teeth of the first sun gear 53, the number of the teeth of the second sun gear 54 and the number of the teeth of the third sun gear 55 are integrally multiplied by the number N of the pinion set of the first, second and third pinions 57, 58 and 59. If the module m' of the first pinion 57, the module m\" of the second pinion 58 and the module m\"' of the third pinion 59 are m\">m'\">m' even if the number of the teeth is Zp.sub.1 =Zp.sub.2 =Zp.sub.3, the pitch circles become rp.sub.1 <rp.sub.3 <rp.sub.2. Here, Zs.sub.1 is 24, Zp.sub.1, Zp.sub.2 and Zp.sub.3 are 18, respectively, Zs.sub.2 is 15, Zs.sub.3 is 18and N is 3. If helical gears are used, and the module of each of the teeth Zs.sub.1 and Zp.sub.1 is 1.5, the module of each of the teeth Zs.sub.2 and Zs.sub.2 is 1.75 and the module of each of the teeth Zp.sub.3 and Zs.sub.3 is 1.72 and if rs.sub.1 is 22.8 mm, rp.sub.1 is 17.1 mm, rp.sub.2 is 21.8 mm and rs.sub.2 is 18.1 mm, and rs.sub.3 and rp.sub.3 are 19.95, respectively, Consequently, the three pinion sets, in which the first, second and third pinions of 57, 58 and 59 each group are arranged at the same phase with of each other, can be equiangularly disposed. Thus, the balance of mass among the three pinions are ensured during the operation, thereby improving the durability of the bearings and reducing noise and vibration of the central differential 50. Further, since the three pinions of each group are in the same phase and a plurality of the pinion sets are equiangularly disposed by determining the number of the teeth and measurements of the gears, assembling and workability of the planetary gear device are improved. It is possible to simplify manufacturing of the gears and to reduce parts of the pinions. Since the measurements of the gears between the first sun gear and the pinion and between the second sun gear and the pinion and between the third sun gear and the pinion can be preferably changed, a wide control of the torque split can be performed. Thus, operability and driveability of the vehicle are accurately and properly controlled, thereby improving efficiencies thereof. The present invention may be adapted to a vehicle with a manual transmission or a continuously variable belt-drive automatic transmission, or to a vehicle with a laterally mounted engine. From the foregoing it will be understood that the present invention provides a torque split control system for a four-wheel drive vehicle where at least two standard torque split ratios are obtained, thereby providing stability of the vehicle, good cornering performance, handling and steerability in accordance with the road conditions and driving conditions so that driving performance is improved. Since the central differential comprises a complex planetary gear device, a sufficient torque is distributed to the rear wheels. While the presently preferred embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described, it is to be understood that these disclosures are for the purpose of illustration and that various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims. * * * * *",

Description BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a torque distribution control system for a four-wheel drive motor vehicle having a central differential, and more particularly to the system for a vehicle with a laterally mounted engine. In the four-wheel drive motor vehicle, a torque distribution ratio of front wheels and rear wheels is determined to coincide with a dynamic weight ratio of the front and rear wheels, so that power of the engine is effectively used at acceleration. In the four-wheel drive motor vehicle based on a front-wheel drive with a front-mounted engine which has a static weight ratio of 60 (front):40 (rear), the ratio between the front torque T.sub.F to the front wheels and the rear torque T.sub.R to the rear wheels is determined in the ratio of 50:50 which is same as the dynamic weight ratio thereof. In the four-wheel drive motor vehicle based on a rear-wheel drive with a front-mounted engine which has the static weight ratio of 50:50, the ratio of the front torque T.sub.F and the rear torque is determined 40:60 in the same ratio as the dynamic weight ratio. Accordingly, the central differential comprising bevel gears is employed in the former vehicle in which the output torque of the engine is equally distributed, and the central differential having a simple planetary gear device is employed in the latter vehicle. The former vehicle ensures safe driving on a slippery road. If a differential lock device is provided for locking the central differential, the driving force of the vehicle is improved. However, the steering ability of the vehicle is not particularly improved. That is, when the vehicle makes a turn at high speed under the differential lock condition, all of the four wheels may slip (slipping spin) at the same time, causing difficulty in driving. In order to ensure driving stability of the vehicle, the torque to the rear wheels is set to a value larger than that to the front wheels by arranging the central differential comprising the simple planetary gear device, so that the rear wheels may slip first. Thus, the vehicle can be safely driven by the front wheels at a small torque while the rear wheels idle. Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open 63-176728 discloses a four-wheel drive motor vehicle in which a central differential comprising a simple planetary gear device is provided. The output of a transmission is transmitted to a carrier of the planetary gear device. The torque is distributed to the front wheels through either one a sun gear or a ring gear and to the rear wheels through the other one. The torque to the front and rear wheels is unequally distributed at the ratio determined by the difference between pitch circles of the sun gear and the ring gear. A fluid-operated multiple-disk friction clutch as a lock device is provided for controlling differential operation. A standard torque distribution ratio determined by the ratio of the pitch circles can not be changed, the unless diameters of the sun gear and the ring gear changes. In order to increase the standard torque distribution ratio, the diameter of the sun gear is decreased or that of the ring gear is increased. However, in a power transmitting system where an axle differential for the front or rear axles and the central differential are coaxially disposed, a plurality of shafts such as axles, a front drive shaft, an input shaft connected to the transmission and a rear drive shaft are disposed, penetrating the sun gear. Therefore, the diameter of the sun gear cannot be decreased. On the other hand, the ring gear cannot be enlarged because of limitation of space and of a required gear ratio. Consequently, the power transmitting system cannot be applied to various vehicles having a different static weight ratio, such as a front-wheel drive vehicle with a front-mounted engine, and a rear-wheel drive vehicle with a rear-mounted and mid-shipped engine. Moreover, since the distribution of torque to the rear wheels can not be set to the large value, a control range of the multiple-disk friction clutch becomes small. Consequently, the vehicle can not be provided with good driveability and steerability. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An object of the present invention is to provide a torque distribution control system for a four-wheel drive motor vehicle having a laterally mounted engine, in which a standard torque ratio of the front wheels and rear wheels can be easily changed. Another object of the present invention is to provide a system in which a large torque is distributed to the rear wheels, thereby enabling control of a wide torque distribution range with a fluid-operated friction clutch. According to the present invention, there is provided a system for controlling the torque distributed to the front wheels and a rear wheels of a motor vehicle having the laterally mounted engine and a laterally mounted transmission, and a central differential disposed coaxially with an axle differential for axles of the vehicle selected from the front or rear axles. The system comprises a central differential having a planetary gear device including a first sun gear connected to an output shaft of a transmission, a carrier, first and second planetary pinions integral with each other and rotatably supported on the carrier, and a second sun gear, the first and second sun gears being coaxial with selected axles, the first planetary pinion being engaged with the first sun gear, and the second planetary pinion being engaged with the second sun gear, a first torque transmitting member connecting the carrier with an axle transmission, a second torque transmitting member connecting the second sun gear with axles other than the selected axles, a fluid-operated multiple-disk clutch disposed between the first and second torque transmitting members so as to restrict differential operation of the planetary gear device, and control means for controlling the clutch torque of the multiple-disk clutch in accordance with driving conditions of the vehicle. In an aspect of the invention, the first torque transmitting member is a first tubular output shaft rotatably mounted on one of the selected axles, and the planetary gear device is arranged such that a torque larger than the torque to the front wheels is transmitted to the rear wheels. In another aspect, the control means comprises a hydraulic circuit for supplying pressurized oil to the fluid operated multiple-disk clutch, and a control unit for controlling the pressure of oil supplied to the clutch. The hydraulic circuit comprises an oil pump, a pressure regulator valve for regulating the pressure of the oil supplied from the oil pump to produce a line pressure, and a clutch control valve for controlling the oil supplied to the clutch, and a solenoid-operated duty control valve for controlling the pressure of the oil supplied to the clutch control valve, the control unit comprising a slip ratio calculator for calculating a slip ratio between the rear wheels and the front wheels in accordance with the ratio between front-wheel speed and rear-wheel speed, clutch pressure setting means responsive to the slip ratio for providing a clutch pressure, and duty ratio providing means responsive to the clutch pressure for producing pulses having a duty ratio corresponding to the clutch pressure which are applied to the duty control valve for controlling the pressure of the oil. The other objects and features of the present invention will become understood from the following description with reference to the accompanying drawings.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS FIGS. 1a, 1b, 2a and 2b show a power transmission system for a four-wheel drive motor vehicle to which the present invention is applied. An engine 10 is laterally mounted on the motor vehicle at a front portion thereof. The power transmission system comprises a clutch 13 connected to the engine 10 through a crankshaft 11 and a flywheel 12 and housed in a clutch housing 1, a manual transmission 30 and a front axle differential 40 housed in a transmission case 2 and a transfer device 70, a central differential 50 and a fluid operated multiple-disk clutch 60 housed in a transfer case 3. The transmission 30 has an input shaft 14, an output shaft 15 parallel with the input shaft 14, five pairs of change-speed gears 31 to 35 corresponding to first to fifth (overdrive) speed gears, and synchronizers 36 to 38. The synchronizers 36 to 38 are disposed between the gears 31 and 32, between 33 and 34 and adjacent the gears 35, respectively. A reverse drive gear 39 mounted on the input shaft 14 meshes with a gear formed on one side of a sleeve of the synchronizer 36 through an idler gear (not shown) for reverse drive. A drive gear 16 fixedly mounted on the output shaft 15 meshes with a final gear 17 which is fixed to flanges of opposed hub members 18 by bolts (FIG. 2a) at an inner periphery of the gear 17. The hub member 18 is rotatably supported in the clutch housing 1 and the transmission case 2 through bearings 19. The front axle differential 40 is disposed inside the hub members 18. As shown in FIGS. 2a and 2b, the front axle differential 40 with a bevel gear has a differential case 41 connected to a first tubular output shaft 21 of the central differential 50. In the differential case 41, there are provided a pinion shaft 42 secured to the differential case 41, two differential pinions 43 rotatably mounted on the pinion shaft 42 and two bevel side gears 44L, 44R meshed with pinions 42. The side gears 44L and 44R are connected to left and right front axles 22L and 22R so as to respectively transmit the output power of the transmission to the left and right front wheels 23L, 23R and to absorb a difference of speeds therebetween. In the transfer case 3, the central differential 50 and the fluid operated multiple-disk clutch 60 are provided coaxially to the front differential 40 and the axle 22R, and the transfer device 70 is disposed behind the central differential 50. The central differential 50 is a complex planetary gear device and has a tubular input (hollow shaft) 20 connected with the hub member 18, and a tubular second output shaft 24 rotatably mounted on the first output shaft 21. The first output shaft 21 is rotatably mounted on the right front axle 22R. The central differential 50 comprises a first sun gear 51 integrally formed on the input shaft 20, three first planetary pinions 52 meshed with the first sun gear 51, a second sun gear 53 integrally formed on the second output shaft 24, three second planetary pinions 54 meshed with the second sun gear 53, and a carrier 55. Referring to FIG. 3, the carrier 55 has a boss 55a, and annular flange portions 55b and 55c integral with the boss 55a. Each of the flange portions 55b and 55c has three holes. Corresponding holes rotatably support a pin 56. The pinions 52 and 54 are integral with each other and rotatably mounted on the pin 56 through needle bearings 57. The boss 55a is engaged with the input shaft 20 through a thrust bearing 49 and splined to the first output shaft 21 through splines 59. The flange portions 55b and 55c are rotatably mounted on the input shaft 20 and the second output shaft 24 through needle bearings 58, respectively. Thus, the output torque from the output shaft 15 of the transmission 30 is transmitted to the first sun gear 51 through the drive gear 16, the final gear 17, the hub member 18 and the input shaft 20 and further to the carrier 55 and the second sun gear 53 through the pinions 52, 54 at predetermined respective torque distribution ratios. The difference between rotating speeds of the carrier 55 and the second sun gear 53 is absorbed by the rotation and revolution of the first and the second planetary pinions 52 and 54. The operation of the central differential 50 for distributing the torque to the front wheels 23L, 23R and rear wheels 28L, 28R will be described hereinafter with reference to FIG. 4. Input torque Ti of the first sun gear 51 and the relationship between the sun gears 51 and the pinions 52, 54 are expressed as follows, respectively. where T.sub.F is a front torque transmitted from the carrier 55 to the first output shaft 21, T.sub.R is rear torque transmitted from the second sun gear 53 to the second output shaft 24, rs.sub.1 is the radius of a pitch circle of the first sun gear 51, rp.sub.1 and rp.sub.2 the radii of the pitch circles of the first and second pinions 52 and 54, respectively, and rs.sub.2 is the radius of the pitch circle of the second sun gear The tangential load P on an engaging point of the first sun gear 51 and the first pinion 52 is equal to the sum of the tangential load P.sub.1 on the carrier 55 and the tangential load P.sub.2 on the engaging point of the second sun gear 53 and the second pinion 54. That is, Substituting equations (1) and (2) for the equation (3), Consequently, it will be seen that the torque distribution for the front torque T.sub.F and the rear torque T.sub.R can be set to various values by changing the radii of the pitch circles of the sun gears 51 and 53 and the pinions 52 and 54. If rs.sub.1 is 23.5 mm, rp.sub.1 is 16.5 mm, rp.sub.2 is 18.8 mm and rs.sub.2 is 211 mm, respectively, the front torque T.sub.F and the rear torque T.sub.R are calculated as Thus, the torque distribution ratio of the front wheels 23L, 23R and the rear wheels 28L, 28R is A large torque can be distributed to the rear wheels 28L, 28R. The clutch 60 comprises a sleeve 61a splined to an inner periphery of a transfer drive gear 71 and supported by a partition 3a, a drive drum 61 secured on the sleeve 61a, a driven drum 62 splined to a flange 21a formed at the end portion of the first output shaft 21, a plurality of disks 67a splined on the drum 61, and a plurality of disks 67b splined on the drum 62, the disks on the respective drums being alternately arranged. A retainer 67c is abuts the innermost disk 67a by a snap ring 67d secured to the drum 61. A piston 64 is provided in the drum 61 and slidably mounted on a hub of the drum 62. An oil chamber 63 is formed between the piston 64 and the drum 61. The transfer drive gear 71 of the transfer device 70 is securely mounted on the second output shaft 24 and rotatably mounted in the transfer case 3 through bearings 47. Thus, the clutch 60 is provided between the carrier 55 and the second sun gear 53 so as to change the torque distribution ratio and to lock the central differential 50. When oil is supplied to the chamber 63, the piston 64 is pushed by the pressure of the oil. The piston 64 pushes the disks 67a and 67b to engage the clutch 60 for producing a clutch torque. A cylindrical retainer 65 is disposed in a space between the piston 64 and the driven drum 62. The retainer 65 is mounted on a hub of the drum 62 and slidably engaged with an inner periphery of the piston 64. Thus, the retainer 65 is water-tightly (sealingly) mounted between the drum 62 and the piston 64, thereby defining a centrifugal oil pressure chamber 66, opposite to the oil chamber 63. A return coil spring 68 is provided in the chamber 66 between the piston 64 and the retainer 65, thereby canceling centrifugal force exerted on the piston 64 upon rotation of the drum 62. The oil for the transmission 30 is different from the oil for the clutch 60. Thus, oil seals 48 are disposed between the partition 3a of the transfer case 3 and the sleeve 61a of the drive drum 61 and between the sleeve 61a and the first output shaft 21 to separate the oil for lubricating the transmission 30 from the oil for operating the clutch 60 by the partition 3a. An oil pump 5 is provided on the partition 3a adjacent the clutch 60 for supplying the oil to the clutch 60. The oil pump 5, is for example, driven by a motor 6 powered by a battery and connected to an oil pressure control unit 7 provided in the transfer case 3 to be applied with electric pulses from a control unit 90 to control the clutch 60. The transfer drive gear 71 engages with a driven gear 74 securely mounted on a transfer shaft 72 of the transfer device 70 which is disposed behind the central differential 50. The transfer shaft 72 is connected to a rear drive shaft 77 perpendicular to the transfer shaft 72 through a pair of bevel gears 75, 76, thereby transmitting the power to rear axles 27L and 27R by way of the rear drive shaft 77, a propeller shaft 25 and a rear differential 26. Referring to FIG. 5 showing a control system for the clutch 60, the oil pressure control unit 7 of the control system comprises a pressure regulator valve 80, a pilot valve 84, a clutch control valve 82 and a solenoid operated duty control valve 87. The regulator valve 80 operates to regulate the pressure of oil supplied from the oil pump 5 driven by the engine to produce a predetermined line pressure and a lubricating oil pressure. An actuating pressure conduit 81 is communicated with a passage 86 through the pilot valve 84. The passage 86 is communicated with the solenoid operated duty control valve 87 downstream of an orifice 85, and with an end port of the clutch control valve 82. The conduit 81 is communicated with the clutch control valve 82 through a passage 81a. The clutch control valve 82 is communicated with the clutch 60 through the passage 83. The solenoid-operated valve 87 is operated by pulses from a control unit 90 at a duty ratio determined therein, so as to control the draining of the oil to provide a control pressure. The control pressure is applied to an end of a spool of the clutch control valve 82 to control the oil supplied to the clutch 60 so as to control the clutch pressure (torque). The control unit 90 is supplied with an output signal from a front-wheel speed sensor 91, a rear-wheel speed sensor 92, a steering angle sensor 93 and a shift position sensor 100 for detecting the shift position of the automatic transmission 30. As shown in FIG. 2b, the front-wheel speed sensor 91 is provided on the transfer case 3 opposite to the carrier 55 of the central differential 50 and the rear-wheel speed sensor 92 is provided opposite to the drive gear 74 mounted on the transfer shaft 72. The control unit 90 has a slip ratio calculator 94 to which the front-wheel and rear-wheel speeds NF and NR are applied. Since the standard torque distribution is determined in accordance with the principle of T.sub.F <T.sub.R, the rear wheels slip first (slipping spin). A slip ratio S is calculated in accordance with the ratio between the front-wheel speed N.sub.F and the rear-wheel speed N.sub.R, S=N.sub.F N.sub.R (S>0). The slip ratio S, a steering angle .psi., and a shift position signal from the sensors 93 and 100 are applied to a clutch pressure setting section 95. In accordance with the input signals, the clutch pressure setting section 95 retrieves a clutch pressure Pc from a clutch pressure look-up table 96. FIG. 6 shows clutch pressures stored in the look-up table 96. When the slip ratio S is S.gtoreq.1, which means that the rear wheels 28L, 28R do not slip, the clutch pressure Pc is set to a small value. When the rear wheels 28L, 28R slip and the slip ratio S becomes S<1, the clutch pressure Pc (clutch torque) increases with a decrease of the slip ratio S. When the slip ratio S becomes smaller than a set value SI, the clutch pressure Pc is set to a maximum Pcmax. Further, when the steering angle .psi. increases, the clutch pressure Pc is decreased, thereby preventing tight corner braking. The clutch pressure Pc is applied to a duty ratio providing section 97 where a duty ratio D corresponding to the derived clutch pressure Pc is provided. A duty signal with a duty ratio D provided at the section 97 is applied to the solenoid-operated duty control valve 87. FIG. 8 is a flowchart showing the operation of the control unit 90. As aforementioned, the front-wheel speed N.sub.F and the rear-wheel speed N.sub.R are detected and slipping of the front wheels 23L, 23R against the rear wheels 28L, 28R is calculated. If the slip ratio is smaller than the set value, a differential operation restricting clutch torque is derived from a look-up table in accordance with a throttle opening degree, vehicle speed, shift position and steering angle. The duty ratio corresponding to the derived clutch torque is applied to the solenoid operated valve 87. When the slip is larger than the set value, a clutch torque is derived from the look-up table 96 for operating the valve 87 at slipping. Describing the operation of the system, the power of the engine 10 is transmitted through the clutch 13 to the manual transmission 30 at which the transmission ratio is controlled. The output of the transmission is transmitted to the first sun gear 51 of the central differential 50 through the output shaft 15, the drive gear 16, the final gear 17, the hub members 18 and the input shaft 20. The front torque TF and the rear torque TR are determined in accordance with the radii of the gears of the central differential 50. The torque is transmitted to the carrier 55 at a ratio, for example 38% and to the second sun gear 53 at a ratio, for example 62%. If a no slip state is detected in the control unit 90 while a vehicle is driven on the dry road (S.gtoreq.r 1), a signal corresponding to the duty ratio of 100% is applied from the duty ratio providing section 97 to the solenoid-operated duty control valve 87. Thus, the clutch control pressure becomes zero and the clutch control valve 82 operates to close the passage 81a, thereby draining the oil from the clutch 60. The clutch 60 is disengaged and the clutch torque becomes zero so as to render the central differential 50 free. Accordingly, the torque of the carrier 55 is transmitted to the front wheels 23L, 23R through the first output shaft 21, front differential 40 and the axles 22L and 22R at the ratio 38%. The torque at a distribution ratio of 62% is transmitted to the rear wheels 28L, 28R through the second sun gear 53, the second output shaft 24, the transfer drive and driven gears 71 and 74, the transfer shaft 72, the bevel gears 75 and 76, the rear drive shaft 77, the propeller shaft 25, the rear differential 26 and the rear axles 27 and 27R. Thus, full-time four-wheel driving is established. At a standard torque distribution ratio, the vehicle is driven under an understeering condition, so that good operability of the vehicle is ensured. Further, the vehicle smoothly negotiates a sharp corner due to the differential operation of the central differential 50. If the vehicle is driven on a slippery road, the rear wheels 28L, 28R slip first because a larger amount of the torque is distributed to the rear wheels 28L, 28R. The slip ratio S.sub.1 is calculated at the slip ratio calculator 94 of the control unit 90. A duty signal corresponding to a clutch pressure Pc.sub.1 in accordance with the slip ratio S.sub.1 (S<1) is applied to the solenoid-operated valve 87. The clutch control valve 82 is operated by the control pressure of the oil obtained by regulating the line pressure at the solenoid-operated valve 87, so that the clutch 60 is engaged at the clutch pressure Pc.sub.1. Consequently, the clutch torque Tc is produced in the clutch 60. The clutch 60 is provided in parallel with the carrier 55 and the second sun gear 53 of the central differential 50. Accordingly, the clutch torque Tc is transmitted from the second sun gear 53 to the carrier 55 to increase the torque to the front wheels 23L, 23R. Thus, the distribution ratio between the front torque and the rear torque T.sub.F :T.sub.R becomes TF.sub. 1 : TR.sub.l, respectively, as shown in FIGS. 7a and 7b. To the contrary, the torque to the rear wheels 28L, 28R is reduced to eliminate slipping, thereby improving driveability to ensure good operability and safe driving. When the slip ratio S becomes smaller than the set value SI, the differential operation restricting torque becomes maximum by the pressure of oil in the clutch 60. Thus, the carrier 55 is directly engaged with the second sun gear 53 to lock the central differential 50. Thus, the four-wheel driving is established in accordance with the torque distribution corresponding to axle loads of the front and rear wheels 23L, 23R, 28L, 28R. Thus, the torque distribution is continuously controlled in accordance with the slip condition for preventing the slipping of the wheels. When the vehicle makes a turn, the clutch torque of the clutch 60 is decreased in accordance with the steering angle .psi., so that the differential limit operation of the central differential 50 is decreased to sufficiently absorb the rotational difference in the speeds of the front and rear wheels 23L, 23R, 28L, 28R, thereby preventing tight corner braking and ensuring good operability. FIGS. 9a, 9b and 10a, 10b show second and third embodiments of the present invention. In the second embodiment shown in FIGS. 9a and 9b, the central differential 50 is disposed behind the manual transmission 30. The central differential 50 is coaxially provided with the front differential 40 on the left axle 22L directly behind the change speed gears 31 to 34. The first sun gear 51 is securely mounted on the input shaft 20 connected to the hub member 18, and the first output shaft 21 supporting the carrier 55 is connected to the differential case 41 of the front differential 40. In the present embodiment, the second output shaft 24 in the first embodiment is omitted. The drive gear 71 is rotatably mounted on the left axle 22L and has a sleeve 71a on which the second sun gear 53 is securely mounted. The drive drum 61 of the clutch 60 is connected to the carrier 55 at the left side thereof and the driven drum 62 is splined on the sleeve 71a. The transfer shaft 72 is extended from the transmission case 2 to the transfer case 3 wherein the bevel gears 75 and 76 are provided. The oil pump 5 is mounted on the transmission case 2. Other construction and operation of the second embodiment are the same as those of the first embodiment. In the third embodiment shown in FIGS. 10a and 10b, the central differential 50 is disposed at a substantially central portion with respect to the width of the vehicle and the front differential 40 is disposed in the transfer case 3 at the same side as the engine. The final gear 17 which is rotatably mounted on the left axle 22L has a sleeve (hollow shaft) 17a. The first sun gear 51 of the central differential 50 is securely mounted on the sleeve 17a and the carrier 55 is securely mounted on the first output shaft 21. The second sun gear 53 is securely mounted on the second output shaft 24 mounted on the first output shaft 21. The first output shaft 21 which is extended to the right is connected to the differential case 41 of the front differential 40. The transfer drive gear 71 is securely mounted on the second output shaft 24. The drive drum 61 of the multiple-disk clutch 60 is disposed on the right side of the front differential 40 and connected to transmitting member 71b integral with the transfer drive gear 71. The driven drum 62 is securely mounted on the differential case 41 of the front differential 40. The other construction and operation are the same as those of the first embodiment. In the second and third embodiments, the front-wheel speed sensor 91 and the rear-wheel speed sensor 92 are disposed at positions appropriate for detecting the front-wheel speed N.sub.F and rear-wheel speed N.sub.R, respectively. FIGS. 11a to 11f show other examples of the central differential 50. In the examples shown in FIGS. 11a, 11c and 11e, the fluid-operated multiple-disk clutch 60 is disposed between the carrier 55 and the input shaft 20 of the central differential 50. Thus, a bypass system 101 comprising the clutch 60 is provided for a transmitting system from the input shaft 20 to the first output shaft 21 and to the second output shaft 24 through the central differential 50. When the rear wheels 28L, 28R slip, the speed difference in the central differential 50 becomes: the rear-wheel speed N.sub.R >the speed of the input shaft 20>the front-wheel speed N.sub.F. A part of the input torque of the input shaft 20 is directly transmitted to the first output shaft 21 through the drive drum 61 of the clutch 60 and the carrier 55 in accordance with the clutch torque Tc. The remaining torque is transmitted to the second output shaft 24 from the first sun gear 51 through the first and second pinions 52 and 54 and the second sun gear 53. The front-wheel torque T.sub.F and the rear-wheel torque T.sub.R are as follows. Since the clutch torque Tc is zero in the no slip state, the torque distribution ratio of the front and rear wheels is T.sub.F :T.sub.R =38:62. When the rear wheels slip to produce clutch torque Tc, the input torque Ti proportional to the clutch torque Tc is directly transmitted to the front wheels 23L, 23R. The input torque Ti transmitted to the front wheels 23L, 23R becomes large with an increase of the clutch torque Tc. In each central differential 50 of FIGS. 11b, 11d and 11f, the input shaft 20 is provided with a transmitting member extending therefrom and passing through the central differential 50 and connected with the drum 61 of the clutch 60 The multiple-disk clutch 60 is disposed between the second sun gear 53 and the input shaft 20. Thus, the bypass system 101 comprising the clutch 60 is provided for the input shaft 20. The front-wheel torque T.sub.F and the rear-wheel torque T.sub.R are as follows. When the rear wheels 28L, 28R slip, the torque corresponding to the sum of the clutch torque Tc and the input torque Ti is transmitted to the front wheels 23L, 23R. The system of the present invention can be employed in a four-wheel drive motor vehicle of other types such as a rear wheel drive vehicle with a rear engine. In accordance with the present invention, the central differential comprises two pairs of sun gears and planetary pinions and a carrier. The standard torque distribution to front wheels 23L, 23R and the rear wheels 28L, 28R is determined by the radii of the pitch circles of the gears and the pinions. Thus, the torque distribution ratio can be set to various values. Accordingly, a rigid and compact system may be made to distribute larger torque to the rear wheels 28L, 28R than that to the front wheels 23L, 23R, without changing the size of the system. Since the large torque is transmitted to the rear wheels 28L, 28R, steerability is improved and slipping of the wheels is accurately detected, thereby improving acceleration characteristics. In addition, a wide control of the torque distribution can be performed. Thus, operability and driveability of the vehicle are accurately and properly controlled, thereby improving efficiencies thereof. The central differential and the fluid-operated multiple-disk clutch are coaxially provided at the rear of the manual transmission in small size. Thus, the central differential can be disposed at any position. Since the input shaft and the output shafts of the central differential are disposed at the central portion of the vehicle, the differential is preferable for a transmission system having coaxially arranged input and output shafts. The system having the central differential provided in the transmission case can be adapted to a two-wheel drive vehicle. The fluid-operated multiple-disk clutch has a sealed construction, so that it is preferable to lubricate the clutch. Since parts of the central differential, the multiple disk clutch and the transfer device are disposed in the transmission case, the system becomes compact, thereby enabling the case to be strengthened. Thus the system is advantageous in reducing oscillation noise. Since the transmission system does not overhang from the engine, the engine can be arbitrarily designed without obstruction. Since the central differential is provided adjacent the transmission, the power train can be simplified. While the presently preferred embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described, it is to be understood that these disclosures are for the purpose of illustration and that various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims. * * * * *",

A system for controlling torque distribution to front wheels and rear wheels of a motor vehicle having a manual transmission with an output shaft, the system comprising: a planetary gear device including a first sun gear connected to said output shaft of said transmission, first and second planetary pinions integral with each other, a carrier provided to rotatably support said pinions and operatively connected to said front wheels, and a second sun gear operatively connected to said rear wheels; said first planetary pinion being engaged with said first sun gear, and said second planetary pinion being engaged with said second sun gear; means for selectively connecting said first sun gear and said second sun gear of said planetary gear device so as to restrict differential operations of said planetary gear device. Description BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a torque distribution control system for a four-wheel drive motor vehicle having a central differential. In a four-wheel drive motor vehicle, a torque distribution ratio of front wheels and rear wheels is determined to coincide with a dynamic weight ratio of the front and rear wheels rather than a static weight ratio thereof, so that the power of the engine may be most effectively used at acceleration. In a four-wheel drive motor vehicle based on a front-wheel drive vehicle with a front-mounted engine, which has the static weight ratio of 60(front):40(rear), the ratio of front torque T.sub.F to front wheels and rear torque T.sub.R to rear wheels is determined in the ratio of 50:50 which is the same as the dynamic weight ratio thereof. In a four-wheel drive motor vehicle based on a rear-wheel drive vehicle with a front-mounted engine, which has the static weight ratio of 50:50, the ratio of the front torque T.sub.F and the rear torque T.sub.R is determined in the same ratio of 40:60 as the dynamic weight ratio. Accordingly, a central differential comprising bevel gears is employed in the former vehicle in which the output torque of the engine is equally distributed, and a central differential having a simple planetary gear device is employed in the latter vehicle. The former vehicle ensures safe driving on a slippery road. If a differential lock device is provided for locking the central differential, the driving force of the vehicle is improved. However, when the vehicle makes a turn at high speed under the differential lock condition, all of the four wheels may slip (i.e. the vehicle spins) at the same time, causing difficulty in driving. In order to ensure a driving stability of the vehicle, the torque to the rear wheels is set to a value larger than that to the front wheels by arranging the central differential comprising the simple planetary gear device, so that rear wheels may slip first. Thus, the vehicle can be safely driven because a driver immediately notices the slipping of the rear wheels before all of the four wheels slip at the same time. Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open 63-176728 discloses a four-wheel drive motor vehicle in which a central differential comprising a simple planetary gear device is provided. The output of a transmission is transmitted to a carrier of the planetary gear device. The torque is distributed to the front wheels through either a sun gear or a ring gear and to the rear wheels through the other gear. The torque to the front and rear wheels is unequally distributed at the ratio determined by the ratio of the pitch circles of the sun gear and the ring gear. The torque distribution ratio can not be changed with the large degree of freedom. Furthermore, it is difficult to change the diameters of the sun gear and the ring gear because of limitation of space in the transmission. Further, in a power transmitting system having a transaxle type of a manual transmission, the central differential must be disposed in a space adjacent to a transfer shaft at the rear of the transmission so as not to reduce a minimum ground clearance and the space in the vehicle. Therefore, it is improper to use the central differential with the simple planetary gear device, because the diameters of the sun gears and ring gears and the torque distribution ratio can not be increased. Moreover, if a fluid operated multiple-disk friction clutch as a lock device is provided for controlling the differential operation, the distribution of torque to the rear wheels can not be set to a large value, so that the control range of the multiple-disk friction clutch becomes small. Consequently, a motor vehicle having good driveability and controllability of handling can not be provided. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An object of the present invention is to provide a torque distribution control system for a four-wheel drive motor vehicle in which the torque ratio of the front wheels and rear wheels can be easily changed. Another object of the invention is to provide a system in which a large torque is distributed to rear wheels, thereby enabling the control of a wide torque distribution range with a fluid operated friction clutch. According to the present invention, there is provided a system for controlling torque distribution to front wheels and rear wheels of a motor vehicle having a manual transmission having an output shaft, comprising a planetary gear device including a first sun gear connected to the output shaft of the transmission, first and second planetary pinions integral with each other, a carrier provided to rotatably support the pinions and operatively connected to the front wheels, and a second sun gear operatively connected to the rear wheels, the first planetary pinion being engaged with the first sun gear, and the second planetary pinion being engaged with the second sun gear, and means for selectively connecting two of the first sun gear, the carrier and the second sun gear of the planetary gear device so as to restrict the differential operations of the planetary gear device wherein said means selectively connects the carrier and the first sun gear or the first and second sun gears.

The sub transmission 15 has reduction gears 17 disposed between the drive shaft 14 and an input shaft 16, and a selector mechanism 18. The sub transmission 15 is adapted to selectively operate to directly engage the drive shaft 14 with the input shaft 16 for providing a high speed range and to engage the drive shaft 14 with the input shaft 16 bypassing the reduction gears 17 for providing a low speed range. A main manual transmission 30 connected to the input shaft 16 has a tubular output shaft 19 parallel with the input shaft 16, five pairs of change-speed gears 31 to 35 corresponding to first to fifth speed gears, synchronizers 36 to 38, and a reverse drive gear 39 engaged with the synchronizer 36 for reverse drive. A front drive shaft 20 is rotatably supported in the output shaft 19. The output shaft 19 is rearwardly extended to an extension case 3 attached to the transfer case 2 and connected to a central differential 50 housed therein. The central differential 50 is connected to the front drive shaft 20 which is connected to a front differential 21 provided under the sub transmission 15 so as to transmit the power to front wheels of the vehicle. The central differential 50 is further connected to a transfer shaft 22 disposed in alignment with the front drive shaft 20. The transfer shaft 22 is connected to a rear drive shaft 23 through transfer gears 24 and 25. The rear drive shaft 23 is disposed in parallel with the front drive shaft 20. The rear drive shaft 23 is connected to rear wheels of the vehicle through a propeller shaft 26 and a rear differential 27. A fluid operated multiple-disk friction clutch 60 is provided in the central differential 50. Referring to FIG. 2a showing the central differential 50, the rear end of the output shaft 19 is rotatably supported in the transmission case 1 through a taper roller bearing 19a. A drive gear shaft 41 is splined to the output shaft 19. The front drive shaft 20 is rotatably mounted in the output shaft 19 through a needle bearing 40. The rear end of the front drive shaft 20 is rotatably mounted in the transfer shaft 22 through a needle bearing 40a. The transfer shaft 22 is supported in the extension case 3 through a ball bearing 42. The central differential 50 is disposed among the drive gear shaft 41 connected with the output shaft 19, front drive shaft 20 and transfer shaft 22. The central differential 50 is a complex planetary gear device and comprises a first sun gear 51 integrally formed on the drive gear shaft 41, a first planet pinion 52 meshed with the first sun gear 51, a second sun gear 53 integrally formed on the transfer shaft 22, a second planetary pinion 54 meshed with the second sun gear 53 and secured to the first planet pinion 52, and a carrier 55. Referring to FIG. 2b, the carrier 55 has a boss 55a, an annular flange portion 55b and a toothed flange 55c opposite to the flange portion 55b. The flange portion 55b and the toothed flange 55c are integrated with the boss 55a. The flange portion 55b and the toothed flange 55c have holes 55d corresponding to each other for supporting a pin 56. The boss 55a is mounted on the drive gear shaft 41 through a thrust bearing 43 and splined to the front drive shaft 20 and secured thereto by a lock nut 44. The flange portion 55b is mounted on a partition 2a of the transfer case 2 through a thrust bearing 43a and the toothed flange 55c is rotatably mounted on the transfer shaft 22 through a bearing 45. Thus, the output torque from the output shaft 19 of the transmission 30 is transmitted to the carrier 55 and the second sun gear 53 through the first sun gear 51 and pinions 52, 54 at predetermined respective torque distribution ratios. The difference between rotating speeds of the carrier 55 and the second sun gear 53 is absorbed by the rotation and revolution of first and second planetary pinions 52 and 54. The operation of the central differential 50 for distributing the torque to front wheels and rear wheels will be described hereinafter with reference to FIG. 3. Input torque Ti of the first sun gear 51 and the relationship between the sun gears and the pinions are expressed as follows, respectively. where T.sub.F is the front torque transmitted from the carrier 55 to the front drive shaft 20, T.sub.R is the rear torque transmitted from the second sun gear 53 to the rear drive shaft 23 through the transfer shaft 22 and transfer gears 24 and 25, rs.sub.1 is the radius of the pitch circle of the first sun gear 51, rp.sub.1 and rp.sub.2 are radii of pitch circles of first and second pinions 52 and 54, respectively, and rs.sub.2 is the radius of the pitch circle of the second sun gear 53. A tangential load P on the engaging point of the first sun gear 51 and the first pinion 52 is equal to the sum of a tangential load P.sub.1 on the carrier 55 and a tengential load P.sub.2 on the engaging point of the second sun gear 53 and the second pinion 54. That is, Substituting equations (1) and (2) for the equation (3), Consequently, it will be seen that the torque distribution for the front torque T.sub.F and the rear torque T.sub.R can be set to various values by changing the radii of the pitch circles of sun gears 51 and 53 and the pinions 52 and 54. If rs.sub.1 is 23.5 mm, rp.sub.1 is 16.5 mm, rp.sub.2 is 18.8 mm and rs.sub.2 is 21.1 mm, the front torque T.sub.F and the rear torque T.sub.R are calculated as Thus, the torque distribution ratio of the front wheels and the rear wheels is A large torque can be distributed to the rear wheels. The clutch 60 comprises a drive drum 61 splined to the toothed flange 55c of the carrier 55, a driven drum 62 splined to the transfer shaft 22 integral with the second sun gear 53, a plurality of disks 67a splined on the drum 61, and a plurality of disks 67 splined on the drum 62, alternately arranged. A retainer 67c is abutted on the innermost disk 67a by a snap ring 67d secured to the drum 61. A piston 64 is provided in the drum 61 and slidably mounted on a hub of the drum 62. An oil chamber 63 is formed between the piston 64 and the drum 61. Thus, the clutch 60 is provided between the carrier 55 and the second sun gear 53 so as to change the torque distribution ratio and to lock the central differential 50. When oil is supplied to the chamber 63, the piston 64 is pushed by the pressure of the oil. The piston 64 pushes the disks 67 and 67a to engage the clutch 60 for producing a clutch torque. A cylindrical retainer 65 is disposed in a space between the piston 64 and the driven drum 62. The retainer 65 is mounted on the hub of the drum 62 and slidably engaged with an inner periphery of the piston 64. Thus, the retainer 65 is watertightly mounted between the drum 62 and the piston 64, thereby defining a centrifugal oil pressure chamber 66 having a large volume, opposite to the oil chamber 63. A return coil spring 68 is provided in the chamber 66 between the piston 64 and the retainer 65. The oil for the transmission 30 is different from the oil for the clutch 60. Thus, oil seals 47 are disposed between the partition 2a of the transfer case 2 and the drive gear shaft 41 and between the front drive shaft 20 and the drive gear shaft 41 at an opening 46 formed in the partition 2a for the drive gear shaft 41 and the front drive shaft 20, to separate the oil for lubricating the transmission 30 from the oil for operating the clutch 60 by the partition 2a. An oil pump 70 is provided on the partition 2a for supplying the oil to the clutch 60. The oil pump 70 comprises a pump housing 74 mounted in a recess 2b formed on the partition 2a and secured to the partition 2a by bolts 75. In the pump housing 74, a drive plate 71, an inner rotor 72 engaged with the drive plate 71 and an outer rotor 73 are provided. A pump drive shaft 76 connected to the crankshaft 11 is mounted in the drive shaft 14 and the input shaft 16. The rear end of the pump drive shaft 76 is operatively connected to the drive plate 71. Oil seals 71a are disposed between the pump housing 74 and the drive plate 71 so as to prevent mixing of oil with the oil for the transmission 30. An oil pressure control unit 77 is provided on the partition 2a for controlling the clutch 60. An oil passage 83 and a lubricating oil passage 78 are formed in the transfer shaft 22. Oil in the control unit 77 is supplied to the oil chamber 63 through the passage 83 and to the centrifugal oil pressure chamber 66 and bearings through the passage 78. The rear drive shaft 23 is supported in a boss 2c of the partition 2a through a needle bearing 40 and a thrust bearing 43b at the front end thereof and supported in the extension case 3 through a ball bearing 42. Referring to FIG. 4 showing a control system for the clutch 60, the oil pressure control unit 77 of the control system comprises a pressure regulator valve 80, a pilot valve 84, a clutch control valve 82 and a solenoid operated duty control valve 87. The regulator valve 80 operates to regulate the pressure of oil supplied from the oil pump 70 driven by the engine to produce a predetermined line pressure and a lubricating oil pressure. An actuating pressure conduit 81 is communicated with a passage 86 through the pilot valve 84. The passage 86 is communicated with the solenoid operated duty control valve 87 downstream of an orifice 85, and with an end port of the clutch control valve 82. The conduit 81 is communicated with the clutch control valve 82 through a passage 81a. The clutch control valve 82 is communicated with the clutch 60 through the passage 83. The solenoid operated valve 87 is operated by pulses from a control unit 90 at a duty ratio determined therein, so as to control draining the oil to provide a control pressure. The control pressure is applied to an end of a spool of the clutch control valve 82 to control an oil pressure applied to the clutch 60 through the passage 83 so as to control the clutch pressure (torque). The control unit 90 is supplied with an output signal from a front-wheel speed sensor 91, a rear-wheel speed sensor 92, a steering angle sensor 93 and a shift position sensor 100 for detecting the shift position of the manual transmission 30. The control unit 90 has a slip ratio calculator 94 to which front-wheel and rear-wheel speeds N.sub.F and N.sub.R are applied. Since the torque distribution is determined in accordance with the principle of T.sub.F <T.sub.R, first the rear wheels slip. A slip ratio S is calculated in accordance with the ratio of the front-wheel speed N.sub.F to the rear-wheel speed N.sub.R, i.e. S=N.sub.F /N.sub.R (S>0). The slip ratio S, a steering angle .psi., a throttle opening degree signal, a vehicle speed signal and a shift position signal from the sensors 93 and 100 are applied to a clutch pressure setting section 95. In accordance with the input signals, the clutch pressure setting section 95 retrieves a clutch pressure Pc from a clutch pressure look up table 96. FIG. 5 shows clutch pressures stored in the look up table 96. When the slip ratio S is S.gtoreq.1, which means that the rear wheels do not slip, the clutch pressure Pc is set to a small value. When the rear wheels slip and the slip ratio S becomes S<1, the clutch pressure Pc (clutch torque) increases with a decrease of the slip ratio S. When the slip ratio S becomes smaller than a set value SI, the clutch pressure Pc is set to a maximum Pcmax. Further, when the steering angle .psi. increases, the clutch pressure Pc is decreased, thereby preventing the tight corner braking phenomena. The clutch pressure Pc is applied to a duty ratio providing section 97 where a duty ratio D corresponding to the derived clutch pressure Pc is provided. A duty signal with a duty ratio D provided at the section 97 is applied to the solenoid operated duty control valve 87. FIG. 7 is a flowchart showing the operation of the control unit 90. As aforementioned, the front-wheel speed N.sub.F and the rear-wheel speed N.sub.R are detected and slipping of the front wheels and rear wheels is calculated. If the slip ratio of rear wheels is smaller than a set value, a differential operation restricting clutch torque is derived from the look up table 96 in accordance with a throttle opening degree, vehicle speed, shift position and the steering angle. The duty ratio corresponding to the derived clutch torque is applied to the solenoid operated valve 87. When the slip ratio of the rear wheels is larger than the set value, a clutch torque is derived from the look up table 96 for operating the valve 87 at slipping. Describing the operation of the system, the power of the engine 10 is transmitted through the clutch 13, the drive shaft 14, the sub transmission 15, and the input shaft 19 to the manual transmission 30 at which the transmission ratio is controlled. The output of the transmission is transmitted to the first sun gear 51 of the central differential 50 through the drive gear shaft 41. The front torque T.sub.F and the rear torque T.sub.R is determined in accordance with the radii of the gears of the central differential 50. The torque is transmitted to the carrier 55 at a ratio, for example 38% and to the second sun gear 53 at a ratio, for example 62%. If a no slip state is detected in the control unit 90 while the vehicle is driven on the dry road, a signal corresponding to the duty ratio of 100% is applied from the duty ratio providing section 97 to the solenoid operated duty control valve 87. Thus, the clutch control pressure becomes zero and the clutch control valve 82 operates to close the passage 81a, thereby draining the oil from the clutch 60. The clutch 60 is disengaged and the clutch torque becomes zero so as to render the central differential 50 free. Accordingly, the torque of the carrier 55 is transmitted to the front wheels through the front drive shaft 20 and the front differential 21 at the ratio 38%. The torque at distribution ratio of 62% is transmitted to the rear wheels through the second sun gear 53, the transfer shaft 22, the transfer gears 24 and 25, the rear drive shaft 23, the propeller shaft 26 and rear differential 27. Thus, a full-time four-wheel driving is established. At the torque distribution ratio, the vehicle is driven under the understeer condition, so that good controllability of the vehicle is ensured. Further, the vehicle smoothly goes through a sharp corner owing to the differential operation of the central differential 50. If the vehicle is driven on a slippery road, the rear wheels slip first because the larger amount of torque is distributed to the rear wheels dependent on the standard torque distribution ratio. The slip ratio S.sub.1 is calculated at the slip ratio calculator 94 of the control unit 90. The duty signal corresponding to clutch pressure Pc.sub.1 in accordance with the slip ratio S.sub.1 (S<1) is applied to the solenoid operated valve 87. The clutch control valve 82 is operated by the control pressure obtained by regulating the line pressure at the solenoid operated valve 87, so that the clutch 60 is engaged at the clutch pressure. Consequently, the clutch torque Tc is produced in the clutch 60. The clutch 60 is provided in parallel with the carrier 55 and the second sun gear 53 of the central differential 50. Accordingly, the clutch torque Tc is transmitted from the second sun gear 53 to the carrier 55 to increase the torque to the front wheels. To the contrary, the torque to the rear wheels is reduced to eliminate slipping, thereby improving controllability of the vehicle and safe driving. Thus, the distribution ratio of the front torque and the rear torque T.sub.F :T.sub.R becomes T.sub.F1 :T.sub.R1, respectively, as shown in FIG. 6. When the slip ratio S becomes smaller than the set value SI, the differential operation restricting torque becomes maximum by the pressure of oil in the clutch 60. Thus, the carrier 55 is directly engaged with the second sun gear 53 to lock the central differential 50. Thus, the four-wheel driving is established in accordance with the torque distribution corresponding to the axle loads of the front and rear wheels. Thus, the torque distribution is continuously controlled in accordance with the slip condition for preventing slipping of the wheels. When the vehicle makes a turn, the clutch torque of the clutch 60 is decreased in accordance with the steering angle .psi., so that the differential limit operation of the central differential 50 is decreased to sufficiently absorb the rotating difference in speeds of the front and rear wheels, thereby preventing the tight corner braking phenomena and ensuring good driveability. FIG. 8a shows another example of the central differential. The fluid operated multiple-disk clutch 60 is disposed between the carrier 55 and the output shaft 19 of the transmission. Thus, a bypass system 113 comprising the clutch 60 is provided for the transmitting system from the output shaft 19 to the front drive shaft 20 and to the rear drive shaft 23 through the central differential 50. When the rear wheels slip, the speed difference in the central differential becomes as follows: rear-wheel speed N.sub.R >speed of output shaft 19>front-wheel speed N.sub.F. A part of the output torque of the output shaft 19 is directly transmitted to the front drive shaft 20 through the drive drum 61 of the clutch 60 and the carrier 55 in accordance with the clutch torque Tc. The remaining torque is transmitted to the carrier 55 and the rear drive shaft 23 from the first sun gear 51 dependent on the torque distribution ratio of the differential 50. The front-wheel torque T.sub.F and the rear-wheel torque T.sub.R are as follows. Since the clutch torque Tc is zero in the no slip state, the torque distribution ratio of the front and rear wheels is T.sub.F :T.sub.R =38:62. When the rear wheels slip to produce clutch torque Tc, a part of the input torque Ti corresponding to the clutch torque Tc is directly transmitted to the front wheels. The torque T.sub.F transmitted to the front wheels becomes large with the increase of the clutch torque Tc. In the central differential of FIG. 8b, the output shaft 19 is provided with a transmitting member 114 extending therefrom and connected with the drum 61 of the clutch 60, consequently which houses the central differential 50. The multiple-disk clutch 60 is disposed between the second sun gear 53 and the output shaft 19. Thus, a bypass system 113a comprising the clutch 60 is provided for the output shaft 19. The front-wheel torque T.sub.F and the rear-wheel torque T.sub.R are as follows. When the rear wheels slip, the torque based on the distribution ratio and the sum of the clutch torque Tc and the input torque Ti is transmitted to the front wheels. In the system, the transfer shaft 22 can be integrated with the rear drive shaft 23 and provided coaxially with the output shaft of the transmission. The system of the present invention can be applied to other types of four-wheel drive motor vehicle such as the type of the rear wheel drive vehicle with a rear engine. In accordance with the present invention, the central differential comprises two pairs of sun gears and planetary pinions and a carrier. The torque distribution of the differential to front wheels and the rear wheels is determined by radii of the pitch circles of the gears and the pinions. Thus, the torque distribution ratio can be set to various values. Accordingly, the system may be made to distribute larger torque to the rear wheels than that to the front wheels, without changing the size of the system. Since large torque is transmitted to the rear wheels, wide controlling of the torque distribution can be performed the fluid operated multiple-disk clutch mounted on the differential. Thus, controllability and driveability of the vehicle are accurately and properly attained, thereby improving efficiencies thereof. The central differential and the fluid operated multiple-disk clutch are coaxially provided at the rear of the manual transmission in the small size. Thus, operations for the torque distribution and the differential lock are smoothly performed. The front drive shaft mounted in the output shaft is connected to the central differential to simplify the construction. The torque to the rear wheels is distributed to the front wheels in accordance with the differential operation restricting torque of the clutch at slipping of the rear wheels, so that linear characteristics is provided. Since the increase of the torque distribution to the front wheels is surely performed in accordance with the bypass system of the clutch, the differential limit operation has a good response. While the presently preferred embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described, it is to be understood that these disclosures are for the purpose of illustration and that various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims. * * * * *",

Description BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a differential device for a four-wheel drive motor vehicle, and more particularly to an arrangement and a structure of a differential device comprising a differential provided between axles and a central differential. In a four-wheel drive motor vehicle having an engine with a transaxle laterally mounted therein, a central differential is disposed in a transmission case and a differential for one of front and rear wheel drive systems is disposed adjacent the central differential. The power transmission system becomes compact as the central differential is completely housed in a transmission case. However, the construction of the transaxle completely differs from that of a two-wheel drive vehicle. Consequently, the transaxle of the two-wheel drive vehicle can not be used for the four-wheel drive vehicle without greatly changing the structure near the final gear devices. To resolve the problem, there has been proposed a four-wheel drive power transmission system in which the central differential is disposed outside the transmission case of the two-wheel drive vehicle. Therefore, the transaxle of the two-wheel drive vehicle becomes compatible with the four-wheel drive vehicle, thereby enabling one to extensively use the same parts, resulting in a reduction of manufacturing cost. U.S. Pat. No. 4,693,334 discloses a differential device for the four-wheel drive vehicle having an engine laterally mounted thereof. In the system, the central differential is provided in the transfer case and the front differential is disposed between a transmission case and the transfer case. However, the differential device has a problem as described hereinafter. In the differential device, as a lock-up clutch is disposed besides a ring gear of the central differential, lubricating oil must be the same as the clutch oil, so that separation of the oil is very difficult. Further, the ring gear becomes large because the pinion gears must be inside the ring gear. And the shafts of the pinions are supported by a carrier, so that each pinion is mounted in a hole formed in the differential case and supported in a form of a cantilever and large stress is concentrated in the carrier. The central differential operates to transmit the output torque of the transmission to the side gears through the differential case, pinion shafts and the pinions. Accordingly, the torque acts to laterally push the pinion shafts, so that the shafts may deflect and sway in accordance with the variation of the torque dependent on the conditions of road surface and engine load. Consequently, the surfaces of the holes in the differential case and the pinion shaft are abraded by excessive surface pressure applied thereto. Particles of the material caused by the abrasion fly into the inner side of the pinions, causing the seizure the pinions to seize, and hence reducing durability and reliability of the system. Moreover, the holes in the differential case are enlarged so that the pinion shafts oscillate, which causes noise. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The object of the present invention is to provide a differential device for a four-wheel drive vehicle where the central differential is arranged so as to decrease the abrasion and vibration of the elements. According to the present invention, there is provided a differential device for a four-wheel drive motor vehicle having an engine laterally mounted on the vehicle, a laterally mounted transmission for transmitting the power of the engine to first axles, a final gear operatively connected to an output shaft of the transmission, a central differential coaxially provided with the first axles, a differential provided between the axles, and a power transmitting system for transmitting the output of the central differential to second axles of the vehicle. The differential device has the central differential including a differential case, a pair of pinion shafts operatively connected to the final gear, a pair of pinions rotatably mounted on the pinion shafts respectively, and first and second side gears engaged with the pinions, the differential including a differential case operatively connected to the first side gear of the central differential, a pair of pinions and a pair of side gears engaged with the latter pinions and secured to the first axles, respectively, the second side gear of the central differential being operatively connected to the power transmitting system. In an aspect of the invention, the pinion shafts are integral with a first drive shaft rotatably provided on one of the first axles and operatively connected to the final gear, the first side gear is connected to the differential case of the differential by a second drive shaft rotatably mounted on the same axle as the first drive shaft. The other objects and features of this invention will become understood from the following description with reference to the accompanying drawings . BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS FIG. 1 schematic diagram of a four-wheel drive power transmission system of the present invention as a first embodiment; FIG. 2 is a sectional view of a main part of the power transmission system; FIG. 3 is an exploded perspective view of a part of a central differential; and FIG. 4 is a schematic diagram showing a main part of a power transmission system of a second embodiment of the present invention. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS FIGS. 1 and 2 show a power transmission system for a four-wheel drive motor vehicle to which the present invention is applied. An engine 1 is laterally mounted on the motor vehicle at a front portion thereof. The power transmission system comprises a clutch 2 housed in a clutch housing 6, a transmission 3, a front differential 4, the latter two being housed in a transmission case 7 and a transfer device 5 housed in an extension case 8. The transmission 3 has an input shaft 10, an output shaft 11 parallel with the input shaft 10, five pairs of change-speed gears 12 to 16 corresponding to first to fifth (overdrive) speed gears, and synchronizers 17 to 19. The synchronizers 17 to 19 are disposed between the gears 12 and 13 and between 14 and 15 and adjacent the gears 16, respectively. A reverse drive gear 20 mounted on the input shaft 10 meshes with a gear 21 formed on one side of a sleeve of the synchronizer 17 through an idler gear (not shown) for reverse drive. An output gear 22 fixedly mounted on the output shaft 11 meshes with a final gear 23 which is fixed to flanges of hub members 24 and 25 by bolts 26 (FIG. 2) at the inner periphery of the gear 23. The hub members 24 and 25 are rotatably supported in the clutch housing 6 and the transmission case 7 through bearings 27a and 27b. The front differential 4 is disposed inside the hub members 24 and 25. The front differential 4 comprises a differential case 30 secured to the hub members 24 and 25, a pinion shaft 31 secured to the differential case 30, two differential pinions 32 rotatably mounted on the pinion shaft 31 and two bevel side gears 33, 34 meshed with the pinions 32. The side gears 33 and 34 are connected to left and right front axles 35 and 36 so as to respectively transmit the output power of the transmission to the left and right front wheels in the same manner as the two-wheel drive vehicle. In the extension case 8, a central differential 9 is provided coaxially with the front differential 4 and the axle 36. The central differential comprises a differential case 40, a pair of pinions 42, a pair of pinion shafts 41 rotatably supporting the pinions 42, and a pair of side gears 43 and 44 meshed with both pinions 42. As shown in FIG. 3, the pinion shafts 41 are integrally formed on a ring 41a which is secured to a tubular first drive shaft 45. Namely the pinion shafts 41 are integral with the drive shaft 45. The first drive shaft 45 is rotatably mounted on a second drive shaft 46 and connected to the hub member 25. Each of the pinions 42 has a spherical end face 42a (FIG. 3) and slidably supported in an annular and spherical groove 40a formed on the inner wall of the differential case 40 so as to revolve in the groove 40a about the second drive shaft 46 with the rotation about the shafts 41. The side gear 43 is integral with a side gear shaft 47 rotatably mounted on the first drive shaft 45 and connected to the differential case 40. The other side gear 44 is securely mounted on the second drive shaft 46 which is connected to the differential case 30 of the front differential 4. The differential case 40 is rotatably mounted in a transfer case 8a through a bearing 48a and connected to a transfer drive gear 50 which is securely mounted on the side gear shaft 47 and rotatably mounted in the extension case 8 through bearings 48b. The transfer drive gear 50 engages with a driven gear 52 securely mounted on a transfer shaft 51 of the transfer device 5 which is disposed behind the axle 36 in parallel therewith. The transfer shaft 51 is connected to a rear drive shaft 55 perpendicular to the transfer shaft 51 through a pair of bevel gears 53, 54, thereby transmitting the power to rear axles 65 by way of a rear drive shaft 55, a propeller shaft 66 and a rear differential 67. In order to restrict the differential operation of the central differential 9, the system of the present invention is further provided with a viscous coupling 60 in a space on the left side of the front differential 4. The viscous coupling 60 comprises a hollow hub 62 secured to the differential case 30 as one of the output members of the central differential 9 and a cylindrical housing 61 secured to the hub member 24 as an output member of the central differential and rotatably supported in the transmission case 7 through the bearing 27b. The hub 62 has a plurality of inner discs 62a and the housing 61 has a plurality of outer discs 61a which are alternately arranged in the axial direction of the viscous coupling 60. High viscous fluid is contained in the housing 61. Describing the operation, the power of the engine 1 is transmitted to the transmission 3 through the clutch 2 and the input shaft 10. By operating the synchronizers 17, 18 and 19, the power of the engine is transmitted to the final gear 23 through the transmission 3. The transmitted power is further transmitted to the pinions 42 of the central differential 9 through the hub member 25, the first drive shaft 45 and the pinion shafts 41. When the pinions 42 revolve about the drive shaft 46, the side gears 43, 44 meshed with the pinions 42 are rotated at the torque distribution ratio of 50:50. The torque is transmitted from the side gear 44 to the differential case 30 of the front differential 4 through the second drive shaft 46. The torque is further transmitted to the left and right wheels through the pinion shaft 31, the pinions 32 and the side gears 33 and 34, and the left and right axles 35 and 36, respectively. At the same time, the torque is transmitted from the side gear 43 to the rear drive wheels through the side gear shaft 47, transfer drive gear 50, driven gear 52, transfer shaft 51, bevel gears 53, 54 and the rear drive shaft 55, thereby establishing a full time four-wheel drive. When the vehicle turns around a corner, the difference between the speeds of the front and rear wheels is absorbed by the operation of the central differential 9. Thus the vehicle can smoothly turn the corner. When one of the front and rear wheels slip and a large speed difference between the hub 62 and the housing 61 occurs, the viscous coupling 60 engages to restrict the differential operation of the central differential 9. Thus, the vehicle can easily get out a condition which it is stuck. FIG. 4 shows another embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment, the viscous coupling 60 is provided adjacent the central differential 9. The second drive shaft 46 and the differential case 40 are extended and connected to the hub 62 and the housing 61 of the coupling 60. Thus, the differential operation of the central differential is restricted by the viscous coupling 60. The present invention may be adapted to a rear drive vehicle with a rear engine and also to a vehicle provided with an automatic transmission or a continuously variable transmission. From the foregoing, it will be understood that the present invention provides a central differential for a four-wheel drive vehicle where adhesion and vibration of pinions are prevented by the pinion shafts integral with the drive shaft, so that the durability and reliability of the differential are improved. Since the differential between the axles is disposed at the same position as the two-wheel drive vehicle, the four-wheel drive vehicle can be easily manufactured by using common parts of the two-wheel drive system. While the presently preferred embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described, it is to be understood that these disclosures are for the purpose of illustration and that various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims. * * * * *",

A system for controlling a torque distribution to a left and a right wheels of a motor vehicle, having a transmission, a differential for distributing an output torque of the transmission to said left and right wheels, and a restricting device for restricting a differential operation of said differential, the system comprising: calculator means for calculating a speed difference between speeds of said left wheel and said right wheel; means for determining an input torque input to said differential and for producing a differential input torque; setting means responsive to the calculated speed difference and said differential input torque for setting a restricting force of said restricting device to a value which increases with an increase of said speed difference and said differential input torque; and control means responsive to said restricting force for operating said restricting device so as to accurately control said torque distribution without wheel slipping. 2. The system according to claim 1, wherein said restricting device is a fluid-operated friction clutch. 3. The system according to claim 1, wherein said differential input torque is determined in accordance with output torque of an engine of said vehicle and a gear ratio of said transmission. Description BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a control system of a torque distribution to left and right driving wheels of a motor vehicle, and more particularly to the control system in which an output torque of a transmission is distributed to the left and right rear driving wheels in accordance with driving conditions of the vehicle. The motor vehicle is provided with a differential between the left and right wheels. If an input torque to the differential is large at driving on a slippery road, the wheels are liable to slip. Accordingly, there is provided a differential operation restricting device for restricting the differential operation of the differential which is operated in response to the input torque. The restricting device previously operates to restrict the differential operation, thereby preventing the wheels from slipping. In a differential operation restricting device having a mechanical engaging device, engaging force for restricting the operation steeply increases at a predetermined input torque. Consequently, when an accelerator pedal of the motor vehicle is depressed at cornering, running behavior of the vehicle may suddenly change due to a rapid change of the engaging force. In order to solve such a problem, a fluid operated multiple-disk friction clutch has been provided. The engaging force of the clutch is continuously changed in accordance with the differential input torque, thereby smoothly controlling the differential restricting clutch torque. Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open 63-184526 discloses such a differential operation control system. The system operates to restrict the differential operation when vehicle speed is smaller than a predetermined value in accordance with vehicle driving torque which is the differential input torque. By the conventional system, the slipping of the wheels can be prevented to ensure driveability of the vehicle. However, since the differential restricting torque is controlled only by the differential input torque, the differential operation is largely restricted when the input torque is large. Accordingly, straight-ahead running and steering characteristics are deteriorated. In particular, when the vehicle negotiates a curve of an uphill road having a high friction coefficient, the differential operation is excessively restricted. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The object of the present invention is to provide a torque distribution control system for left and right driving wheels where a differential operation is properly controlled to improve straight-ahead running performance and steerability. According to the present invention there is provided a system for controlling a torque distribution to a left and right wheels of a motor vehicle, having a transmission, a differential for distributing an output torque of the transmission to the left and right wheel, and a restricting device for restricting the differential operation of said differential. The system comprises calculator means for calculating a speed difference between speeds of the left wheel and the right wheel, means for determining an input torque input to the differential and for producing a differential input torque, setting means responsive to the calculated speed difference and the differential input torque for setting a restricting force of the restricting device to a value which increases with increases of the speed difference and the differential input torque, and control means responsive to the restricting force for operating the restricting device. Thus, when the vehicle is driven on a dry road where the speed difference is small, the restricting force is set to a small value. The other objects and features of this invention will become understood from the following description with reference to the accompanying drawings . BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS FIGS. 1a and 1b show a power transmission system for a four-wheel drive motor vehicle according to the present invention; FIG. 2 is a graph showing a characteristic of differential operation restricting clutch torque corresponding to differential input torque and the difference between right-wheel speed and left-wheel speed; and FIG. 3 is a flowchart showing the operation of a control unit in the system . DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT FIGS. 1a and 1b show a power transmission system for a rear-wheel drive motor vehicle with a front-mounted engine according to the present invention. An engine 1 is mounted on a front portion of the vehicle. A clutch 2 and a transmission 3 are disposed at the rear of the engine 1 in a longitudinal direction of the vehicle. An output of the transmission 3 is transmitted to an output shaft 4. The output shaft 4 is connected to a rear drive shaft 6 through a propeller shaft 5. The rear drive shaft 6 is connected to a rear differential 10 and further to left and right rear wheels 8L and 8R through axles 7L and 7R. The rear differential 10 comprises a bevel gear differential device mounted in a differential case 13. The rear differential 10 comprises a final gear 12 integral with the case 13 and meshed with a pinion 11 secured to the drive shaft 6, a pair of differential pinions 14 rotatably mounted in the case 13, and a pair of side gears 15R and 15L meshed with the pinions 14. The side gears 15R and 15L are connected to the right and left axles 7R and 7L, respectively. A fluid operated multiple-disk friction clutch 16 is provided between the differential case 13 and the side gear 15R of the rear differential 10 for restricting the differential operation of the differential 10. The clutch torque T.sub.D of the clutch 16 is controlled in accordance with the input torque of the differential 10 for restricting the differential operation. A hydraulic circuit of a control system for the clutch 16 comprises an oil pump 20, a pressure regulator valve 21, a pilot valve 25, a clutch control valve 23 and a solenoid operated duty control valve 28. The regulator valve 21 operates to regulate the pressure of oil supplied from the oil pump 20 driven by the engine 1 to produce a line pressure and the line pressure is applied to a line pressure conduit 22. The conduit 22 is communicated with a passage 27 through the pilot valve 25. The passage 27 is communicated with the solenoid operated duty control valve 28 at downstream of an orifice 26, and with an end of the clutch control valve 23 through a passage 29. The conduit 22 is communicated with the clutch control valve 23 through a passage 22a. The clutch control valve 23 is communicated with the clutch 16 through a passage 24. The solenoid operated valve 28 is operated by pulses from a control unit at a duty ratio determined therein, thereby controlling the drain of the oil to provide a control pressure. The control pressure is applied to the clutch control valve 23 to control the oil supplied to the clutch 16 so as to control the clutch pressure (torque) and hence the differential operation restricting clutch torque T.sub.D. The control unit 40 is supplied with output signals from an engine speed sensor 30, a throttle position sensor 31, and inhibitor switch 32, a left rear-wheel speed sensor 33L, and a right rear-wheel speed sensor 33R. An engine speed Ne and a throttle opening degree .theta. from the engine speed sensor 30 and the throttle position sensor 31 are applied to an engine torque calculator 41 from which an engine torque Te is retrieved from a stored table provided therein in accordance with Ne and D. The shift position switch 32 is provided for producing a transmission range signal representing a selected gear in the transmission 3. The transmission range signal is applied to a gear ratio detector 42 where a gear ratio Gm of a selected range of the transmission is detected. The engine torque Te and the gear ratio Gm are applied to a differential input torque calculator 43. A differential input torque Ti to the rear differential 10 is calculated in accordance with the engine torque Te, the gear ratio Gm and a final gear ratio Gf as follows. The differential input torque Ti is applied to a clutch torque setting section 44 where the differential operation restricting torque T.sub.D is set in accordance with the input torque Ti. As shown in FIG. 2, the restricting clutch torque T.sub.D is controlled to be smoothly increased in accordance with the differential input torque Ti. The control unit 40 has a speed difference calculator 45 to which a left rear-wheel speed .omega.L and a right rear-wheel speeds .omega.R from the sensors 33L and 33R are applied. In the speed difference calculator 45, a difference .DELTA..omega. between the speed .omega.L and .omega.R is calculated as, .DELTA..omega.=.vertline..omega.L-.omega.R.vertline.. Thus, the actual slipping state of the wheels is determined. The difference .DELTA..omega. is applied to the differential operation restricting clutch torque setting section 44 to correct the clutch torque T.sub.D. The restricting torque T.sub.D is corrected corresponding to the speed difference .DELTA..omega.. Namely, as shown in FIG. 2, when the speed difference .DELTA..omega. is small in no slip state, a rise of the clutch torque T.sub.D is reduced As the speed difference .DELTA..omega. increases, the rise of the clutch torque T.sub.D is increased. The clutch torque T.sub.D is applied to a control quantity providing section 46 where a duty ratio D corresponding to the clutch torque T.sub.D is provided. The duty ratio D provided at the section 46 is applied to the solenoid operated duty control valve 28 through a driver 47. The operation of the system will be described hereinafter with reference to the flowchart of FIG. 3. The power of the engine 1 is transmitted to the transmission 3 through the clutch 2 at which the transmission ratio is controlled. The output of the transmission 3 is transmitted from the output shaft 4 to the rear differential 10 through the propeller shaft 5 and the rear drive shaft 6. The torque is transmitted to the rear wheels 8L, 8R through the axles 7L and 7R. Thus, a two-wheel drive system is provided The engine torque Te is calculated in the engine torque calculator 41 in accordance with the engine speed Ne and the throttle opening degree 0 from the engine speed sensor 30 and the throttle position sensor 31. The differential input torque Ti is calculated in the differential input torque calculator 43 based on the engine torque Te, the gear ratio Gm dependent on the input signal from the shift position switch 32 and the final gear ratio Gf. Furthermore, the differential operation restricting clutch torque T.sub.D is set in accordance with the input torque Ti at the differential operation restricting torque setting section 44. The left rear-wheel speed .omega.L and the right rear-wheel speed .omega.R are detected by the left rear-wheel speed sensor 33L and the right-wheel speed sensor 33R. The speed difference .DELTA..omega. is calculated in the speed difference calculator 45 for determining the slipping state of the wheels. When the input torque is large at the starting or acceleration of the vehicle, a large clutch torque T.sub.D is determined. The differential operation restricting clutch torque T.sub.D is set at the setting section 44 by retrieving the torque T.sub.D from the look up table in accordance with the differential input torque Ti and the speed difference .DELTA..omega. as parameters. Furthermore, if the vehicle is driven on a slippery road and one of the left and right rear-wheels 8L, 8R slips due to the difference between the friction coefficients .mu. at the left and the right wheels, the speed difference .DELTA..omega. becomes large. In such a case, the large clutch torque T.sub.D is also set. Thus, a signal having a small duty ratio D is applied to the solenoid operated valve 28. The clutch control pressure increases to operated valve 28. The clutch control pressure increases to operate the clutch valve 23, thereby opening the passage 22a. The clutch 16 is thus supplied with oil so that the clutch torque T.sub.D increases so as to restrict the differential operation of the rear differential 10. Consequently, the slip is supressed, thereby preventing the vehicle from becoming stuck. Thus, running performance of the vehicle is improved. When the calculated difference is small owing to the high friction coefficient .mu. of the road, a small clutch torque is determined. A signal having a large duty ratio corresponding to the small clutch torque is applied to the solenoid operated duty control valve 28. Thus, the clutch control pressure becomes zero and the clutch control valve 23 operates to close the passage 22a, thereby draining the oil from the clutch 16. The clutch 16 is disengaged and the clutch torque T.sub.D becomes zero so as to render the rear differential 10 free. Accordingly, the torque is equally transmitted to the left rear-wheel 8L and the right rear-wheel 8R, thereby improving steerability and driving stability. The differential input torque may be detected by a torque sensor. Furtheremore, the system of the present invention can be applied to a four-wheel drive vehicle. In accordance with the present invention, the differential operation restricting force is controlled in accordance with the differential input torque. The restricting force is corrected based on the slip condition determined by the speed difference between the left wheel and and the right wheel. In no slip state, the restricting force is reduced to improve the straight-ahead running performance and the steerability. While the presently preferred embodiment of the present invention has been shown and described, it is to be understood that this disclosure is for the purpose of illustration and that various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims. * * * * *",

Description BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a central differential provided in a power transmission system for a four-wheel drive motor vehicle. Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open 55-72420 discloses a central differential which comprises a differential case, encasing two differential pinion gears and two bevel side gears meshed with pinion gears, and internally splined to drive wheel axles, and a ring gear attached to the case and engaged with a drive pinion. In order to restrain the differential operation, two sets of clutch plates operated by oil pressure are provided for locking the drive wheel axles to the case on a slippery road. Pressure oil is applied to clutches through a hydraulic circuit having a solenoid operated valve. Accordingly, the structure of such a central differential is complicated. Further, the central differential is locked, after a control system detects slipping of wheels in accordance with the speed difference of front and rear drive wheels in excess of a predetermined value. Thus, the locking operation is inevitably ineffective. Japanese Utility Model Application Laid-Open 61-123250 discloses a differential comprising a worm gear and a worm wheel for permitting the differential operation when a motor vehicle makes a turn. When the vehicle travels on a straight road, the differential is locked because of the irreversible function of the worm gear. This differential may be employed for a central differential. However, in such a structure, since the worm gear device has a large sliding resistance, the transmission efficiency is reduced and wearing of the gears increases. Further, since the worm gear is used, the structure of the differential is complicated so that manufacturing cost increases. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The object of the present invention is to provide a system which is simple in structure and compact in size. The other objects and features of this invention will become understood from the following description with reference to the accompanying drawings . BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram of a four-wheel drive power transmission system of the present invention; and FIG. 2 is a sectional view of a differential system of the present invention. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT FIG. 1 shows a power transmission system for a four-wheel drive motor vehicle to which the present invention is applied. An engine 1 is laterally mounted on the motor vehicle at a front portion thereof. The power transmission system comprises a clutch 2 housed in a clutch housing 6, transmission 3 and transfer device 6 the latter two being housed in a transmission case 7 and an extension case 8. The transmission 3 has an input shaft 10, an output shaft 11 parallel to the input shaft 10, five pairs of change-speed gears 12 to 16 corresponding to first to fifth (overdrive) speed gears, and synchronizers 17 to 19. The synchronizers 17 to 19 are disposed between the gears 12 and 13, between gears 14 and 15 and adjacent the gears 16, respectively. A reverse drive gear 20 mounted on the input shaft 10 meshes with a gear 21 formed on one side of a sleeve of the synchronizer 17 through an idler gear (not shown) for reverse drive. A drive gear 22 fixedly mounted on the output shaft 11 meshes with a final gear 23 integral with a differential case 27 of a differential device of the transfer device 5. The transfer device 5 has a central differential 9 and a front differential 4. The central differential 9 (a first differential) is composed of planetary gear devices and disposed between the final gear 23 and a differential device 24 of the front differential 4. The front differential 4 (a second differential) is connected to axles 25 and 25a so as to transmit the power to front wheels 26 of the vehicle. Referring to FIG. 2, a differential case 27 of the front differential 4 has a hub 28 rotatably mounted on the axle 25a and a hub 28a rotatably mounted on the axle 25. The hub 28 and 28a are rotatably mounted on bearings 30, 30 provided in bearing cases 29. The central differential 9 comprises an input tubular body 35 rotatably mounted on the hub 28. At an end of the tubular body 35 adjacent the case 27, an annular projection is formed, on which an annular external side gear 38 is provided. The final gear 23 is splined to the other end portion of the tubular body 35. A cylindrical center gear 36 is rotatably mounted on the tubular body 35 adjacent the gear 38. The center gear 36 has a pair of external gears 36a and 36b, which are different from each other in number of teeth. Adjacent the gear 36a, an external side gear 37 is splined to the tubular body 35. The number of teeth of the side gear 37 is different from the number of teeth of the side gear 38. A carrier 40 having a cylindrical portion 40a is rotatably mounted on the tubular body 35 between the final gear 23 and the side gear 37. A double planet gear 39 is rotatably mounted on a shaft 41 secured to the carrier 40 and a carrier plate 45a. The planet gear 39 has an outer planet pinion 39a meshed with the side gear 37 and an inner planet pinion 39a ' meshed with the gear 36a of the center gear 36. The planet pinions 39a and 39a ' are different from each other in number of teeth. Three planet gears 39 carried by the carrier 40 are circumferentially disposed on the tubular body 35 at equal angular intervals. A carrier 43 integral with the differential case 27 carries a double planet gear 42 rotatably mounted on a shaft 44 secured to the case 27 and a carrier plate 45. Similarly, the planet gear 42 has planet pinions 42a and 42b' which are engaged with the side gear 38 and the gear 36b of the center gear 36, respectively. The pinions 42b, 42b' are also different in number of teeth. An output ring gear 46 in the form of a bevel gear is attached to an outer periphery of the cylindrical portion 40a of the carrier 40 by bolts 50. Referring to FIG. 1, the output bevel gear 46 engages with a bevel gear 47 securely mounted on a rear drive shaft 48, thereby transmitting the power to rear wheels by way of a propeller shaft 49. For differential operation, the structure of the gear train of the central differential 9 of the present invention has the when the vehicle goes around a corner, the front and rear driving wheels with respect to the corner move in opposite directions by the same amount. When the carriers 40 and 43 are rotated one revolution, gear speeds n.sub.a and n.sub.b of internal gears 36a and 36b of the center gear 36 are represented as follows. where S.sub.1 is the number of teeth of side gear 37, C.sub.1 is the number of teeth of gear 36a of center gear 36, P.sub.1 and P'.sub.1 are the numbers of the teeth of the planet pinions 39a and 39a' of planet gear 39, S.sub.2 is the number of teeth of side gear 38, C.sub.2 is the number of teeth of gear 36b of center gear 36, and P.sub.2 and P'.sub.2 are the numbers of the teeth of planet pinions 42a and 42b' of planet gear 42. Thus, when a difference between both the equations becomes zero, namely the gear speed n.sub.a equals to the gear speed n.sub.b in the same direction, the differential operation is achieved. In that case, if the speed of the wheels rotated in the reverse direction is represented by the negative quantity, the above equations are expressed as follows. Thus, the number of teeth of each gear is determined to satisfy the above equation. On the other hand, when the vehicle drives on a straightaway, the gear train is operated to restrict the rotation of the gears. Describing the operation, the power of the engine 1 is transmitted to the transmission 3 through the clutch 2 and the input shaft 10. By operating the synchronizers 17, 18 and 19, the power of the engine is transmitted to the final gear 23 through the transmission 3. The transmitted power is further transmitted to the tubular body 35, so that the side gears 37 and 38 rotate the to try to rotate planet gears 39 and 42. In straightaway driving, each of the planet gears 39 and 42 is subjected to the rotational force of body 35 through the side gears 37 and 38. However, the speeds of both planet gears which are applied to the center gear 36 are different from each other because of the different gear ratios. Accordingly, the center gear 36 cannot be rotated. Thus, the gear train is in an undifferentiating state so that the gears are integrated with the tubular body 35, and, carriers 40 and 43 to equally transmit the power to the front drive wheels 26 through the differential device 24 and drive axles 25 and 25a. At the same time, the power is transmitted to the rear drive wheels (not shown) through the output gear 46, gear 47, and shafts 48, 49. When the vehicle turns around a corner, the carriers 40 and 43 of the central differential 9 are rotated in the opposite directions, relatively in accordance with the difference between the speeds of the front and rear wheels. The carriers 40 and 43 rotate the planet gears 39 and 42 to rotate gears 36a and 36b of the center gear 36 at the same speeds in accordance with the gear ratios. Thus, the difference between the speeds of the front and rear wheels is absorbed. In this state, the carrier 43 rotates to transmit the power to the differential device 24, where the difference between the speeds of the inner and outer drive wheels is absorbed. The carrier 40 rotates in the opposite direction to the carrier 43 at the same amount as the carrier 43 to transmit the power to the rear drive wheels, relatively. Accordingly, the vehicle smoothly turns the corner with the central differential function. On the other hand, if either of the front or rear wheels float or on slippery surface of the road, the load for the wheels reduces. Accordingly, one of planet gears 39 or 42 corresponding to the wheels attempts to rotate. However, since the pitch circles of the planet gears are slightly different from each other, the rotary force dependent on the difference is cancelled by sliding friction on the shaft of the planet gears. Thus, the torque to the wheels going to spin is transmitted to the other wheels, thereby preventing the wheels from spinning. In accordance with the present invention, a central differential comprises a planetary gear device having a differentiating state during cornering and an undifferentiating (differential locking state) during straightaway driving or driving floating or slipping of wheels. Thus, the structure is simplified and compact in size without a differential restraining/locking device. Since a worm gear device is not employed, friction in the device is reduced at cornering, thereby reducing fuel consumption. Since the gears for the central differential are coaxially disposed with each other at a position between the final gear and the differential device, the construction is simplified and the lubrication oil for the gears may be sufficiently supplied. A pair of carriers as output members are disposed at an outermost position. Accordingly, the carriers may be easily integrated with the differential device and the output gear. While the presently preferred embodiment of the present invention has been shown and described, it is to be understood that this disclosure is for the purpose of illustration and that various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims. * * * * *",

Description BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a central differential provided in a power transmission system for a four-wheel drive motor vehicle. Japanese patent application Laid-Open 55-72420 discloses a central differential which comprises a differential case, encasing two differential pinion gears and two bevel side gears meshed with pinion gears, and internally splined to drive wheel axles, and a ring gear attached to the case and engaged with a drive pinion. In order to restrain the differential operation, two sets of clutch plates operated by oil pressure are provided for locking the drive wheel axles to the case on a slippery road. Pressure oil is applied to clutches through a hydraulic circuit having a solenoid operated valve. Accordingly, the structure of such a central differential is complicated. Further, the central differential is locked, after a control system detects slipping of wheels of the vehicle in accordance with the speed difference of front and rear drive wheels in excess of a predetermined value. Thus, the locking operation is inevitably ineffective. Japanese Utility Model Application Laid-Open 61-123250 discloses a differential comprising a worm gear and a worm wheel for permitting the differential operation when a motor vehicle makes a turn. When the vehicle travels on the straight road, the differential is locked because of the irreversible function of the worm gear. This differential may be employed for a central differential. However, in such a structure, since the worm gear device has a large sliding resistance the transmission efficiency reduces and wearing of the gears increases. Further, since the worm gear is used, the structure of the differential is complicated so that manufacturing cost increases. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The object of the present invention is to provide a system which is simple in structure and compact in size. The other objects and features of this invention will become understood from the following description with reference to the accompanying drawings . BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram of a four-wheel drive power transmission system of the present invention; and FIG. 2 is a sectional view of a differential system of the present invention. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT FIG. 1 shows a power transmission system for a four-wheel drive motor vehicle to which the present invention is applied. An engine 1 is laterally mounted on the motor vehicle at a front portion thereof. The power transmission system comprises a clutch 2 housed in a clutch housing 6, transmission 3 and transfer device 5, the latter two housed in a transmission case 7 and an extension case 8. The transmission 3 has an input shaft 10, an output shaft 11 parallel with the input shaft 10, five pairs of change-speed gear 12 to 16 corresponding to first to fifth (overdrive) speed gears, and synchronizers 17 to 19. The synchronizers 17 to 19 are disposed between the gears 12 and 13, between 14 and 15 and adjacent the gears 16, respectively. A reverse drive gear 20 mounted on the input shaft 10 meshes with a gear 21 formed on one side of a sleeve of the synchronizer 17 through an idler gear (not shown) for reverse drive. A drive gear 22 fixedly mounted on the output shaft 11 meshes with a final gear 23 integral with a differential cover 30 of a differential device of the transfer device 5. The transfer device 5 has a central differential 9 and a front differential 4. The central differential 9 (a first differential) is composed of planetary gear devices and disposed between the final gear 23 and a differential device 24 of the front differential 4 (a second differential). The front differential 4 is connected to axles 25 and 25a so as to transmit the power to front wheels 26 of the vehicle. Referring to FIG. 2, the central differential 9 is housed in the differential cover 30. The differential cover 30 comprises a cylindrical body 30a and a conical body 30b secured to the cylindrical body 30a by bolts 32 at their flanges. The final gear 23 is secured to the cylindrical body 30a by bolts 31. In the cover 30, an annular center gear 33 is rotatably mounted on an inner wall of the body 30a. The center gear 33 has a pair of internal gears 33a and 33b, which are different from each other in number of teeth. Adjacent the gear 33a, an internal gear 34 formed on an inner periphery of the final gear 23 is provided as a side gear. Adjacent the gear 33b, an annular side gear 35 is disposed between the cylindrical body 30a and the conical body 30b and secured thereto by bolts 32. The number of teeth of the side gear 34 is different from the number of teeth of the side gear 35. A carrier hub 42 integral with a differential case 27 of the front differential 4 is rotatably mounted on the drive axle 25a. A hub 27a of the differential case 27 is rotatably mounted on the drive axle 25. The differential case 27 supports two differential pinion gears 28 and two bevel side gears 29 meshed with pinion gears 28 and internally splined to front drive wheel axles 25 and 25a, respectively. Carrier hub 42 and hub 27a are rotatably mounted on bearings 44, 44 provided in bearing cases 43. The end of the conical body 30b is mounted on the hub 27a through a radial bearing 45 and a thrust bearing 46. A carrier hub 48 is mounted rotatably mounted on the axle 25a by being mounted on the carrier hub 42 through a needle bearing 47 and mounted in an annular boss 23a formed on the final gear 23 through a radial bearing 50 and a thrust bearing 51. Both ends of the carrier hub 48 are held by thrust bearings 49. The carrier hub 48 has a radially extending portion on which a rear drive wheel output gear 52 is externally formed. A first carrier 40 and a second carrier 37 are provided. A shaft 38 is secured to the carrier 37 formed on the hub 48. A shaft 41 is secured to the carrier 40 integral with the carrier hub 42. A double planet gear 36 is rotatably mounted on the shaft 38. The planet gear 36 has an outer planet pinion 36a meshed with the side gear 34 and an inner planet pinion 36a' meshed with the gear 33a of the center gear 33. The planet pinions 36a and 36a' are different from each other in number of teeth. Three planet gears 36 carried by the carrier 37 are circumferentially disposed on the carrier hub 42 at equidistant positions. Similarly, a double planet gear 39 is rotatably mounted on the shaft 41. The planet gear 39 has planet pinions 39b and 39b ' which are engaged with the side gear 35 and the gear 33b of the center gear 33, respectively. The pinions 39b, 39b ' are also different in number of teeth. Referring to FIG. 1, the output gear 52 engages with a driven gear 53 securely mounted on a transfer shaft 54 of the transfer device 5. The transfer shaft 54 is connected to a rear drive shaft 57 perpendicular to the transfer shaft 54 through a pair of bevel gears 55, 56, thereby transmitting the power to rear wheels of the vehicle by way of a propeller shaft 58. For differential operation, the structure of the gear train of the central differential 9 of the present invention has a relation as follows. When a vehicle goes around the corner, the front and rear driving wheels with respect to the corner move in opposite directions by the same amount. When the carriers 37 and 40 are rotated one revolution, gear speeds n.sub.a and n.sub.b of the internal gears 33a and 33b of the center gear 33 are represented as follows. where S.sub.1 is the number of teeth of side gear 34, C.sub.1 is the number of teeth of gear 33a of center gear 33, P.sub.1 and P'.sub.1 are numbers of the teeth of planet pinions 36a and 36a' of planet gear 36, S.sub.2 is the number of teeth of side gear 35, C.sub.2 is the number of teeth of gear 33b of center gear 33, and P.sub.2 and P'.sub.2 are numbers of the teeth of planet pinions 39b and 39b' of planet gear 39. Thus, when the difference between both the equations becomes zero, namely the gear speed n.sub.a equals to the gear speed n.sub.b in the same direction, the differential operation is achieved. In that case, if the speed of the wheels rotated in the opposite direction is represented by the negative quantity, the above equations are expressed as follows. Thus, the number of teeth of each gear is determined to satisfy the above equation. On the other hand, when the vehicle drives on a straightaway, the gear train is operated to restrict rotations of the gears. Describing the operation, the power of the engine 1 is transmitted to the transmission 3 through the clutch 2 and the input shaft 10. By operating synchronizers 17, 18 and 19, the power of the engine is transmitted to the final gear 23 through the transmission 3. The transmitted power is further transmitted to the differential cover 30, so that the side gears 34 and 35 rotate to try to rotate planet gears 36 and 9. In straightaway driving, each of the planet gears 36 and 9 is subjected to the rotational force of differential cover 0 through the side gears 34 and 35. However, the speeds of both planet gears which are applied to the center gear 33 are different from each other because of the different gear ratios. Accordingly, the center gear 33 cannot be rotated. Thus, the gear train is in undifferentiating state so that the gears are integrated with the differential cover 30, and the carriers 37 and 40 to equally transmit the power to the front drive wheels 26 through the differential device 24 and drive axles 25 and 25a. At the same time, the power is transmitted to the rear drive wheels (not shown) through the output gear 52, gears 53, 55, 56 and shafts 54, 57, 58. When the vehicle turns around a corner, carriers 37 and 40 of the central differential 9 are rotated in the opposite directions, relatively in accordance with the difference between the speeds of the front and rear wheels. The carriers 37 and 40 rotate the planet gears 36 and 39 to rotate gears 33a and 33b of the center gear 33 at the same speeds in accordance with the gear ratios. Thus, the difference between the speeds of the front and rear wheels is absorbed. In this state, the carrier 40 rotates to transmit the power to the differential device 24, where the difference between the speeds of the inner and outer drive wheels is absorbed. The carrier 37 rotates in the opposite direction to the carrier 40 at the same amount as the carrier 40 to transmit the power to the rear drive wheels, relatively. Accordingly, the vehicle smoothly turns the corner with the central differential function. On the other hand, if either of the front or rear wheels float or are on a slippery surface of the road, the load for the wheels reduces. Accordingly, one of the planet gears 36 or 39 corresponding to the wheels attempts to rotate. However, since the pitch circles of the planet gears are slightly different from each other, the rotary force dependent on the difference is cancelled by sliding friction on the shaft of the planet gears Thus, the torque to the wheels which are going to spin is transmitted to the other wheels, thereby preventing the wheels from spinning. In accordance with the present invention, the central differential comprises a planetary gear device having the following functions: a differential operation; and an operation restraining the differential operation. Thus the structure is simplified without the differential restraining locking device. Since the worm gear device is not employed, friction in the device is reduced at cornering, thereby reducing fuel consumption. Since the gears for the central differential are coaxially disposed with each other at a position between the final gear and the differential device, the construction is simplified and the lubrication oil for the gears may be sufficiently supplied. While the presently preferred embodiment of the present invention has been shown and described, it is to be understood that this disclosure is for the purpose of illustration and that various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims. * * * * *",

Description BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a system for transmitting the power of an engine to front and rear wheels of a four-wheel drive vehicle and more particularly to an arrangement in a transfer device of the system. Japanese Utility Model Laid open 61-170747 discloses a power transmitting system having a final reduction gear secured to a case of a differential, front axles to which the power of an engine is transmitted from a transmission through the final reduction gear, a transfer shaft disposed in parallel to the front axles, a transfer gear rotatably mounted on the transfer shaft and in mesh with the final reduction gear, a drive bevel gear secured to the transfer shaft and in mesh with a driven bevel gear of a rear drive shaft which is perpendicularly disposed to the transfer shaft, and a coupling device provided on the transfer shaft to connect the transfer gear with the transfer shaft for transmitting the power to the transfer shaft. The coupling device is disposed between the transfer gear and the axis of the rear drive shaft, and the bearings for supporting the transfer shaft are disposed on both ends thereof. Since the rear drive shaft and the differential are disposed near the center line of the body of the vehicle, with respect to the width thereof, the lengths of the right and left front axles are substantially equal to each other, thereby preventing the vehicle from deviating from a course. In such a device, there is a problem that the transfer shaft is deflected by the centrifugal force and thrust exerted on the drive bevel gear. Thus, engaging surfaces of the bevel gears are obliquely shifted, generating gear noise. In addition, the transfer shaft is supported at the ends thereof so that a heavy load consisting of the coupling device, transfer gear and drive bevel gear is exerted on the transfer shaft. Furthermore, a space is formed about the bevel gears, so that oil is accumulated therein. Such a structure having an oil accumulation space causes not only lubrication efficiency in the transmission system to deteriorate, but also increases the weight thereof. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The object of the present invention is to provide an arrangement of the transfer device for a four-wheel drive vehicle where the above-described disadvantages can be obviated. According to the present invention, there is provided a transfer device for transmitting power of an engine to driving wheels of a four-wheel drive vehicle, comprising a transfer shaft rotatably mounted in a case by first and second bearings, a transfer gear rotatably mounted on the transfer shaft at a portion between the bearings and engaged with a final reduction gear, a coupling device provided outside the first bearing for engaging the transfer gear with the transfer shaft, a drive bevel gear secured to the transfer shaft at a portion outside the second bearing, and a driven bevel gear engaged with the drive bevel gear, for transmitting the power. The other objects and features of this invention will become understood from the following description with reference to the accompanying drawing. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING The only FIGURE is a sectional view showing a part of a four-wheel drive power transmission system according to the present invention. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT Referring to the FIGURE, a power transmission system of a four-wheel drive vehicle has a left and a right front axle 1a and 1b, for driving front wheels of the vehicle, to which the output of the transmission is transmitted through a final reduction gear 2 and a differential 3. The final reduction gear 2 is secured to a differential case 3e of the differential 3. Pinion gears 3c and 3d pivotally mounted on the case 3e mesh with bevel gears 3a and 3b which are integrally formed on the left and right axles 1a and 1b, respectively. A transfer device housed in an extension case 4 has a transfer gear 6 rotatably mounted on a central part of a transfer shaft 5 which is disposed in parallel to the front axles 1a and 1b, and engaged with the final reduction gear 2. The transfer shaft 5 is rotatably supported in the case 4 by a bearing 8 and a bearing 11 outside of the transfer gear 6 through a boss (longitudinal extension) 6a of the gear 6. Securely mounted on a right end portion of the transfer shaft 5 is a drive bevel gear 7 at the outside of the bearing 8 in the form of a cantilever. The bevel gear 7 is in mesh with a driven bevel gear 10 formed on a rear drive shaft 9 disposed substantially on a center line with respect to the width of the body of the vehicle. On a left end portion of the transfer shaft 5, a coupling device 17 is provided in the form of a cantilever, for providing a four wheel drive mode. The coupling device 17 is in the form of a synchromesh device and comprises a clutch gear 12 splined to boss 6a of the transfer gear 6, hub 15 splined to the transfer shaft 5, synchronizer clutch 14 mounted on the hub 15 for selectively engaging with the clutch gear 12, and a shifter 13 for axially shifting the synchronizer clutch 14. When the shifter 13 is operated so as to engage the synchronizer clutch 14 with the gear 12, the rotation of the transfer gear 6 is transmitted to the transfer shaft 5 and further to the rear drive shaft 9. The extended portion of the transfer shaft 5 outside of the extension case 4 is covered by a case cover 16 attached to the case 4. In this arranged transfer device, although the transfer shaft 5 is supported not at both ends but only at inner portion, the bearings 8 and 11 are provided adjacent the bevel gear 7 and the coupling device 17 so that the transfer shaft 5 is prevented from deflecting. Since the centrifugal force and thrust do not affect the bevel gears 7 and 10, the engaging surfaces thereof are not shifted in a bias direction, and the transmission of power without gear noise is ensured. Moreover, the load on the transfer shaft can be distributed over the whole length thereof. From the foregoing, it will be understood that the present invention provides a transfer device for a four-wheel drive vehicle where deflection of the transfer shaft is prevented, and an oil accumulation can be reduced, thereby increasing the lubrication efficiency. While the presently preferred embodiment of the present invention has been shown and described, it is to be understood that this disclosure is for the purpose of illustration and that various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims. * * * * *",

Description BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a system for transmitting the power of an engine to four driving wheels of a four-wheel drive vehicle. In a conventional four-wheel drive vehicle having a central differential, which is called a full time four-wheel drive vehicle, the central differential operates to uniformly distribute the torque of an engine to the front wheels and to the rear wheels of the vehicle. However, if one of the four wheels skids, the torque is not transmitted to the four wheels, so that the vehicle stops. In order to prevent such a problem, a lock mechanism for locking the central differential is provided. As a lock mechanism for the system, a system employing a solenoid-operated dog clutch is known. Further, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 59-179425 discloses a system in which the front wheels are connected to the rear wheels by a fluid clutch or a viscous clutch. When the rotational speeds of the rear wheels are lower than a predetermined speed range compared with those of the front wheels, the rear wheels are driven by the power for the front wheel drive through a one-way clutch. However in the former case, since the clutch is operated by a driver in accordance with conditions of the surface of a road, it causes troublesome operation. In the latter system, it is difficult to determine the capacity of the viscous clutch for setting a viscous mode and a hump mode. Further, in order to obtain an appropriate operational characteristic, the viscous clutch must have a comparatively large capacity. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The object of the present invention is to provide a power system which is compact in size and automatically operates to restrict the differential operation of the central differential in accordance with driving conditions. The other objects and features of this invention will become understood from the following description with reference to the accompanying drawings . BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram of a four-wheel drive power transmission system of the present invention; FIG. 2 is an enlarged sectional view showing a part of the system. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT FIG. 1 shows a power transmission system for a four-wheel drive motor vehicle to which the present invention is applied. An engine 1 is longitudinally mounted on the motor vehicle at a front portion thereof, thus forming a transaxle type. The power transmission system housed in a transmission case comprises a clutch 2, sub-transmission 4, main transmission 8 and transfer device 20. The sub-transmission 4 connected to the clutch 2 through a drive shaft 3 has a reduction gear 6 disposed between the drive shaft 3 and an input shaft 5, and a selector mechanism 7. The sub-transmission 4 is adapted to selectively operate to directly engage the drive shaft 3 with the input shaft 5 for providing a high speed range and respectively to engage the drive shaft 3 with the input shaft 5 bypassing the reduction gears 6 for providing a low speed range. The main transmission 8 connected to the input shaft 5 has a tubular output shaft 9 parallel with the input shaft 5, five pairs of change-speed gears 10 to 14 corresponding to first to fifth speed gears, synchronizers 15 to 17, and a reverse drive gear (not shown). A front drive shaft 18 is rotatably supported in the output shaft 9. A drive pinion 9a at the front end of the shaft 18 meshes with a crown gear of a front differential 19 so as to transmit the power to front wheels of the vehicle. The transfer device 20 is disposed behind the main transmission 8 at the rear end of the output shaft 9 and comprises a central differential 36 and a viscous coupling 40. The transfer device 20 has a drive shaft 21 disposed in alignment with the front drive shaft 18, and is connected to a rear drive shaft 12 through transfer gear 22. The rear drive shaft 23 is disposed in parallel with the front drive shaft 18. The rear drive shaft 23 is connected to rear wheels of the vehicle through a propeller shaft 24 and a rear differential 25. Accordingly, torque of the engine is distributed to the front wheels and rear wheels, and the difference between the rotational speeds of these wheels is absorbed. Referring to FIG. 2, the transfer device 20 is provided in a chamber 27 formed in an extension case 28 secured to a transmission case 29, and further has a front cylindrical casing 30 mounted on the output shaft 9 and a differential casing 32 connected to the front casing 30. In the casing 31, which also can be considered a part of the central differential 36, the central differential 36 and the viscous coupling 40 are provided coaxially with the drive shaft 21. The central differential 36 comprises a pair of pinion shafts 32, each secured to the casing 31 and a center ring 31a which is rotatably mounted on the shaft 21, and a pair of pinion gears 33, each rotatably mounted on one of the pinion shafts. A differential gear 35 meshes with the pinion gears 33 and is securely mounted on the drive shaft 21, and a differential gear 34 meshes with the pinion gears 33. The viscous coupling 40 comprises a housing 38 having a plurality of outer disks 38a, a tubular output shaft 37b integral with the housing 38 and secured to the front drive shaft 18, a hub 39 secured to the drive shaft 21 and having a plurality of inner disks 39a, an input shaft 37a integral with the differential gear 34 and secured to the housing 38, and a high viscous fluid contained in a space defined by the hub 39, the shaft 37a and the housing 38. The disks are alternately arranged in the axial direction of the coupling 40. When there is a speed difference between the housing 38 and the hub 39, the viscous coupling 40 operates to generate torque in dependency on the difference. Thus, the torque is transmitted from a higher speed disk side to a lower speed disk side. A bearing 41 is disposed between the housing 38 and the drive shaft 21 for providing appropriate clearances 41a, 41b between the hub 39 and the housing 38 and between the hub 39 and the shaft 37a. The power of the engine 1 is transmitted to the sub-transmission 4 through the clutch 2 and the drive shaft 3, and further to the main transmission 8. The torque of the main transmission 8 is transmitted to pinion gears 33 of the differential 36 through the output shaft 9, front casing 30, differential casing 31, and pinion shafts 32. At normal driving, the torque is transmitted to the front wheels through differential gear 34, shaft 37a, housing 38, output shaft 37b, and front drive shaft 18. The torque is further transmitted to the rear wheels through differential gear 35, drive shaft 21, transfer gears 22, rear drive shaft 23, propeller shaft 24 and rear differential 25. When the rear wheels skid, a speed difference between the front and rear wheels occurs. The torque of the rear drive shaft 23 is transmitted to the drive shaft 21. The hub 39 secured to the drive shaft 21 rotates faster than the housing 38. The difference of the rotational speeds between the outer disks 38a and inner disks 39a generates a coupling torque which is transmitted to the lower speed side, namely to the outer disks 38a. Accordingly, the torque is transmitted to the differential gear 34, thereby preventing the pinion gears 33 from rotating. Thus, the differential operation is restricted. This means that the central differential 36 is automatically locked. In case of skidding of the front wheels, the central differential is locked in a similar manner to the above described operation. From the foregoing, it will be understood that the present invention provides a system in which a viscous coupling is combined with a central differential for automatically locking the central differential. The viscous coupling is combined with the central differential to achieve a compact structure, so that an increase in the size of the transmission is prevented. While the presently preferred embodiment of the present invention has been shown and described, it is to be understood that this disclosure is for the purpose of illustration and that various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims. * * * * *",

Description BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a differential provided in a final reduction device of a power transmission system for a motor vehicle or a central differential provided in a four-wheel drive motor vehicle. In an automobile, a differential is provided between axles of drive wheels for permitting one of the drive wheels to turn at a different speed from the other wheel, while power of an engine is transmitted from a drive shaft to the drive wheel axles. In brief, the differential comprises a differential case, encasing two differential pinion gears and two bevel side gears meshed with pinion gears, and internally splined to drive wheel axles, and a ring gear attached to the case and engaged with a drive pinion. The differential operation is performed in accordance with the speed difference of the drive wheels caused by the difference of coefficient of friction of a road, even if the motor vehicle is travelling straight ahead which causes one wheel to turn faster than the other. In order to avoid such a defect, nonslip differentials are used in many automobiles, in which two sets of clutch plates are provided for locking the drive wheel axles to the case. However, the structure of such a differential is complicated. Japanese Utility Model Application Laid-Open 61-123250 discloses a system for controlling a differential comprising a worm gear and a worm wheel for permitting the differential operation when a motor vehicle makes a turn. When the vehicle travels on a straight road, the differential is in inoperative state because of the irreversible function of the worm gear. However, in such a system, since the worm gear is used, the structure of the differential is complicated so that the manufacturing cost increases. Further, since the worm gear device has a large sliding resistance, the transmission efficiency is reduced and wearing of the gears increases. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The object of the present invention is to provide a system which is simple in structure and improved in operability. According to the present invention, there is provided a differential for a motor vehicle comprising a rotatably supported differential case, a pair of output shafts rotatably supported and inserted into the differential case, a pair of carriers provided in the differential case and secured to the output shafts respectively, a pair of annular side gears securely provided in the differential case, and an annular center gear rotatably mounted in the differential case, a pair of planetary gears, each comprising a pair of planetary pinions and rotatably supported in one of the carriers, one of the planetary pinions of each planetary gear being engaged with a respective side gear and the other planetary pinions being engaged with the center gear. In an aspect of the invention the gear ratio between one of the planetary pinions and the center gear is different from the gear ratio of another other planetary pinion and the center gear.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS FIG. 1 is a sectional view of a differential according to the present invention; FIG. 2 is a perspective view of the differential partly shown by a cutaway view; and FIG. 3 is a schematic diagram showing an operation of gears in the differential. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT Referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, a differential housed in a differential carrier 1 comprises a differential case 5, a ring gear 4 attached to the case 5 by bolts 6 at a flange 5f. A drive pinion 3 at an end of a drive shaft 2 is engaged with the ring gear 4 for transmitting the power of an engine to the differential. The differential case 5 comprises a cylindrical body 5a and a side disk plate 5b secured to the body 5a by bolts 6 at their flanges 5e and 5f. Hubs 5c and 5d formed on the side plate 5b and the body 5a are rotatably mounted on bearings 8, 8 provided in bearing cases 7 secured to the differential carrier 1. Drive wheel axles (output shafts) 12 and 13 connected to drive wheels 10 and 11 are rotatably mounted in hubs 5c and 5d and sealed by oil seals 9. In the case 5, an annular center gear 20 is rotatably mounted on an inner wall of the cylindrical body 5a. The center gear 20 has a pair of internal gears 20a and 20b, which are different from each other in number of teeth. A pair of annular side gears 21 and 22 are disposed opposite sides of the center gear 20 and secured to the cylindrical body 5a by pins 23, respectively. The number of teeth of the side gear 21 is different from the number of teeth of the side gear 22. A pair of carriers 25 and 30 are secured to the axles 12 and 13 by spring pins 27 at cylindrical portion 25a and 30a and serrated portions 26 of the axles 12 and 13, respectively. The carriers 25 and 30 have opposite carrier plates 25b and 30b to which shafts 28 are secured by force fit. A double planet gear 24 is rotatably mounted on one of the shafts 28. The planet gear 24 has an outer planet pinion 24a meshed with the side gear 21 and an inner planet pinion 24a' meshed with the gear 20a of the center gear 20. The planet pinions 24a and 24a' are different from each other in number of teeth. Three planet gears 24 carried by the carrier 25 are circumferentially disposed in the cylindrical body 5a at equidistant positions. Similarly, a double planet gear 29 is rotatably mounted on the shaft 28. The planet gear 29 has planet pinions 29b and 29b' which are engaged with the side gear 22 and the gear 20b of the center gear 20, respectively. The pinions 29b, 29b' are also different from each other in number of teeth. For differential operation, the structure of the gear train of the present invention has the following relation. When the vehicle goes around the corner, the inner and outer driving wheels with respect to the corner rotate in opposite directions by the same amount about the differential, respectively. When the carriers 25 and 30 are rotated one revolution, gear speeds n.sub.a and n.sub.b of internal gears 20a and 20b of the center gear 20 is represented as follows. where S.sub.1 is the number of teeth of the side gear 21, C.sub.1 is the number of teeth of the gear 20a of the center gear 20, P.sub.1 and P'.sub.1 are the numbers of the teeth of the planet pinions 24a and 24a' of planet gear 24, S.sub.2 is the number of teeth of the side gear 22, C.sub.2 is the number of teeth of the gear 20b of center gear 20, and P.sub.2 and P'.sub.2 are the numbers of the teeth of planet pinions 29b and 29b' of planet gear 29. Thus, when a difference between both the equations becomes zero, namely the gear speed n.sub.a equals the gear speed n.sub.b in the same direction, the differential operation is achieved. In that case, if the speed of the wheels rotated in the reverse direction is represented by the negative quantity, the above equations are expressed as follows. Thus, the number of teeth of each gear is determined to satisfy the above equation. On the other hand, when the vehicle drives on a straightaway, the gear train is operated to restrict the rotations of the gears. Namely, powers different in speed are applied to the center gear 20 through the differential case 5, side gears 21, 22 and planet gears 24, 29. Accordingly, the center gear 20 is unable to rotate so that the gear train goes in a non-differential state. Thus, the gears are integrated with the case 5 to equally transmit the power to the drive wheel axles 12 and 13. Referring to FIG. 3 showing the differential operation. When the drive shaft 2 rotates, the drive pinion 3 rotates the ring gear 4 and hence the differential case 5, so that the side gears 21 and 22 rotate to rotate the planet gears 24 and 29. When the vehicle turns to the left, the drive wheel 11 on the axle 13 is rotated in a direction (shown by an arrow), and the carrier 30 causes the planet pinion 29b of the planet gear 29 to revolve about the axle 13 and to rotate about the shaft 28. As a result, the internal gear 20b' causes the center gear 20 to rotate. If the rotating speed of the drive wheel 11 is .DELTA.n, the center gear speed is .DELTA.n'.sub.c, gear ratio K' is K'=S.sub.2 .multidot.P'.sub.2 /C.sub.2 .multidot.P.sub.2, and the center gear speed .DELTA.n'.sub.c is Similarly, the drive wheel 10 is rotated in the opposite direction with respect to the differential, and the planet gear 24 is rotated by the carrier 25 to rotate the center gear 20. If the wheel speed of the drive wheel 10 is -.DELTA.n, the center gear speed is .DELTA.n.sub.c, gear ratio K is K=S.sub.1 .multidot.P'.sub.1 /C.sub.1 .multidot.P.sub.1, and the center gear speed .DELTA.n.sub.c is Since it is determined that K+K'=2, the equation is replaced as .DELTA.n.sub.c =(1-K').DELTA.n. Thus, .DELTA.n'.sub.c =.DELTA.n.sub.c is obtained, thereby providing a smooth differential operation. In straightaway driving, each of the planet gears 24 and 29 is subjected to the rotational force of the differential case 5 through the side gears 21 and 22. However, the speeds of both planet gears which are applied to the center gear 20 are different from each other because of different gear ratios. Accordingly, the center gear cannot be rotated. Thus, the gear train is locked so that the axles 12 and 13 are integrally engaged with the differential case 5 and rotated together. Furthermore, if the drive wheel 10, for example, is on a slippery road during driving of the vehicle, the carrier 25 attempts to spin with revolution and rotation of the planet gear 24. By the way, since the radii (r1, r1') of pitch circles of each planetary pinion (24a, 24a') are set slightly different from each other, the rotational force of the planet gear 24 caused by the difference of the radii (r1, r1') becomes substantially zero because of the existence of the sliding resistance between the planet gear 24 and the shaft 28. Accordingly, the revolution and rotation of the planet gear 24 are restricted. Similarly, rotation of the carrier 25 is restricted, so that the power is transmitted to the drive wheel 11. In accordance with the present invention, the differential operation is performed at cornering without restriction by friction. In straightaway driving, the differential is locked, so that driveability is improved. While the presently preferred embodiment of the present invention has been shown and described, it is to be understood that this disclosure is for the purpose of illustration and that various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims. * * * * *",

Description BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a system for transmitting the power of an engine to four wheels of a four-wheel drive vehicle and more particularly to a system provided with a viscous coupling for transmitting the power. A four-wheel drive vehicle of the type in which a transfer clutch in a form of a dog clutch, hydraulic clutch or electromagnetic clutch is provided for transmitting the output torque of a transmission to auxiliary drive wheels is known. In such a vehicle, a power transmission system can be converted from a two-wheel drive system to a four-wheel drive system by engaging the transfer clutch. However, if a dog clutch is employed as a transfer clutch, the difference of speeds between front wheels and rear wheels cannot be absorbed when the clutch is engaged. Although a hydraulic clutch slips to absorb the speed difference, a complicated hydraulic control system must be installed. Recently, a viscous coupling containing a high viscous fluid such as a silicon oil has been proposed as a transfer clutch. The viscous coupling operates to transmit the torque in proportion to the difference between input speed and output speed. The viscous coupling may either be used as a devise for locking a control differential, or be used as a transfer clutch which operates to transfer the torque to the auxiliary wheels to provide a four-wheel drive system when the auxiliary wheels skid. Moreover, the slipping in the viscous coupling prevents a tight corner braking at cornering. Japanese Utility Model Application Laid Open No. 59-188731 discloses a power transmitting system for a four-wheel drive vehicle provided with a viscous coupling. A four-wheel driving mode or a two-wheel driving mode can be selected by connecting and disconnecting the transfer device. However, in the four-wheel driving mode, power is transmitted to the rear wheels while the viscous coupling slips so that the power transmitting characteristic and driveability of the vehicle decrease and the fuel consumption increases. Additionally, since temperature of the silicon oil contained in the viscous coupling rises as the result of the continuous slipping, the viscosity of the oil decreases. Thus, clutch torque becomes too small for increasing driveability on muddy and snowy rough roads. In order to eliminate such drawbacks, it is preferable to lock the viscous coupling so as to directly connect the front and rear drive systems with each other. However, if the viscous coupling is adapted to be manually locked, the locking of the coupling is determined by the decision of a driver of the vehicle, which is disadvantageous to beginners. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The object of the present invention is to provide a power transmitting system having a viscous coupling and a lock system wherein the viscous coupling may either be operated as a transfer clutch or locked automatically so as to directly transmit torque to auxiliary wheels of a vehicle or transmit the torque through the viscous coupling. According to the present invention, there is provided a power transmitting system for a four-wheel drive vehicle having an engine, and a transmission for transmitting power of the engine to main driving wheels, the system comprising a viscous coupling provided in a power transmitting system for transmitting the power to auxiliary driving wheels, a lock device provided for locking the viscous coupling so as to directly transmit the power to the auxiliary driving wheels, detector means for detecting driving torque of the power transmitting system, comparator means for comparing the detected driving torque with a predetermined driving torque and for producing an output signal when the detected driving torque exceeds the predetermined driving torque, an actuator responsive to the output signal for operating the lock device to lock the viscous coupling. In an aspect of the invention, the lock device is provided to lock a housing of the viscous coupling to a shaft of the viscous coupling, and the actuator is a vacuum operated actuator having a chamber defined by a diaphragm. The other objects and features of this invention will become understood from the following description with reference to the accompanying drawings . BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram of a four-wheel drive power transmission system of the present invention; and FIGS. 2a and 2b show a detailed sectional view of a viscous coupling and a locking device thereof and a block diagram of a control unit for controlling the locking device. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT FIG. 1 shows a power transmission system for a four-wheel drive motor vehicle to which the present invention is applied. An engine 1 is laterally mounted on the motor vehicle at a front portion thereof. The power transmission system comprises a clutch 2 housed in a clutch housing 6, and a transmission 3 and transfer device 5 housed in a transmission case 7 and an extension case 8. The transmission 3 has an input shaft 10, five pairs of change-speed gear 12 to 16 corresponding to first to fifth (overdrive) speed gears, and synchronizers 17 to 19. The synchronizers 17 to 19 are disposed between the gears 12 and 13, between 14 and 15 and adjacent the gears 16, respectively. A reverse drive gear 20 mounted on the input shaft 10 meshes with a gear 21 formed on one side of a sleeve of the synchronizer 17 through an idler gear (not shown) for reverse drive. A drive gear 22, which is securely mounted on the output shaft 11, meshes with a final reduction gear 23 having a large diameter and connected with a front differential 24 through a shaft, thereby forming final reduction device 4. The front differential 24 is connected to axle shafts 25 so as to transmit the power to front wheels of the vehicle. The transfer device 5 comprises a lateral transfer shaft 26 and a viscous coupling 35 mounted on the shaft 26. The viscous coupling 35 is connected to the final reduction gear 23 through a transfer gear 30. The transfer shaft 26 is connected to a rear drive shaft 28 perpendicular to the transfer shaft 26 through a pair of bevel gears 27, thereby transmitting the power to rear wheels of the vehicle by way of a propeller shaft 29. Referring to FIGS. 2a and 2b, the viscous coupling 35 comprises a hollow hub 36 mounted on the transfer shaft 26 through splines and a cylindrical housing 37 rotatably mounted on the hub 36 through a bearing 38. A high viscous fluid is contained in the housing 37 and sealed by a pair of oil rings 39. The hub 36 has a plurality of perforated inner discs 40 and the housing 37 has a plurality of perforated outer discs 41. The inner and outer discs are alternately arranged in the axial direction of the viscous coupling 35. The housing 37 is connected to the transfer gear 30 through a tubular shaft 42 which is rotatably mounted on the shaft 26 and fixed to the housing 37 by bolts 43. When there is a speed difference between the hub 36 and the housing 37, the viscous coupling operates to transmit the torque. The transmitting torque increases with increase of the difference. Thus, the torque is transmitted from a high speed disc side to a lower speed disc side. Mounted on the transfer shaft 26 adjacent the transfer gear 30 is a lock device 45 for locking the hub 36 and the housing 37. The lock device 45 has the same construction as the synchromesh device. Namely it comprises a hub 46 mounted on the transfer shaft 26 through splines and a selector sleeve 47 slidably mounted on the outer periphery of the hub 46. The sleeve 47 is slidable in the axial direction of the shaft 26 so as to engage with outer teeth 48 of the transfer gear 30. The selector sleeve 47 is further engaged with a fork 50 which is securely mounted on a rail 49 disposed in parallel with the transfer shaft 26 and supported by the transmission case 7. The rail 49 is connected to a diaphragm 52a of a vacuum operated actuator 52 of an automatic change-over device 51 disposed outside of the transmission case 7. A chamber of the actuator 52 is communicated through a passage 61 with a solenoid operated valve 62 which is controlled by output signal of a control unit 56. The valve 62 has a port 62a opened to the atmosphere and a port 62b communicated with an intake passage of the engine to be applied with vacuum pressure, and a solenoid 62c. The control unit 56 has an engine torque calculator 57 where engine torque T.sub.e is obtained, for example from a torque graph, in dependency on a throttle opening degree .theta. detected by a throttle position sensor 54 and an engine speed Ne detected by an engine speed sensor 55. The control unit 56 is further provided with a gear ratio providing section 58 which determines a gear ratio i in dependency on an output signal of a select position sensor 53. The select position sensor 53 detects which of the first to fifth and reverse gears is selected. The engine torque T.sub.e and the gear ratio i are applied to a driving torque calculator 59 which calculates a driving torque T.sub.D in accordance with the following equation. T.sub.D =T.sub.e .times.i .times.IF/R where IF is a final reduction gear ratio and R is a constant for effective radius of tires. The driving torque T.sub.D is applied to a viscous coupling lock deciding section 60 wherein the driving torque T.sub.D is compared with a predetermined lock torque T.sub.S which is obtained from a gripping force of tires. The deciding section 60 produces a lock signal when the driving torque T.sub.D is larger than the predetermined torque T.sub.S T.sub.D >T.sub.S so as to operate the solenoid operated valve 62 through a driver 63. The operation of the present invention is described hereinafter. The power of the engine 1 is transmitted to the transmission 3 through the clutch 2 and the input shaft 10 an further to the front wheels through output shaft 11, drive gear 22, final reduction gear 23, front differential 24 and axle shafts 25. When the vehicle is driven on an ordinary road, the driving torque T.sub.D, which is calculated by the calculator 59 dependent on the engine speed Ne, throttle opening degree .theta. and the gear ratio i, is smaller than the predetermined torque T.sub.S (T.sub.D .ltoreq.T.sub.S). Thus, a lock signal is not applied to the solenoid 62c of solenoid operated valve 62. Accordingly, the vacuum port 62b of valve 62 is closed as shown in FIG. 2a, so that the chamber of actuator 52 is opened to the atmosphere thereby retaining of valve 62 is closed as shown in FIG. 2a, so that the chamber the rail 49 at a position shown in FIG. 2a. Thus, the selector sleeve 47 is not engaged with the teeth 48 of the transfer gear 30. Therefore, the vehicle is driven under a viscous coupling operating mode. During such a driving mode, the torque is transmitted to the rear wheels through final reduction gear 23, transfer gear 30, viscous coupling 35, transfer shaft 26, rear drive shaft 28, and propeller shaft 29. When the speed difference between the front and rear wheels is small, outer discs 41 in the viscous coupling 35 slip with respect to inner discs 40 to transmit a smaller torque to the rear wheels than to the front wheels. If the front wheels skid, the housing 37 operatively connected to the front wheels rotates much faster than the hub 36. A large difference of the rotational speeds between the inner discs 40 and outer discs 41 generates a transmitting torque which is transmitted to the lower speed side, namely to the inner discs 40. Thus, the rear torque is increased and the front torque is reduced so that four wheel driving is provided. When the vehicle is driven on a rough road, the driving torque T.sub.D increases and exceeds the predetermined torque T.sub.S (T.sub.D >T.sub.S). Thus, the viscous coupling lock deciding section 60 produces a lock signal to energize the solenoid 62c to open the vacuum port 62b of solenoid operated valve 62. Accordingly, vacuum is applied to the actuator 52 to move the diaphragm 52a and hence slide the rail 49 to the right. The selector sleeve 47 is forced by the fork 50 to slide to the right, thereby engaging the teeth 48 as shown by a chain line in FIG. 2a. Accordingly, the transfer gear 30 is operatively connected to the shaft 26, and the housing 37 is locked to the shaft 26. The torque is transmitted from the final reduction gear 23 to the transfer shaft 26 through the transfer gear 30, selector sleeve 47 and hub 46. Thus, the directly connected four wheel driving mode is established. Under the driving mode, the torque is constantly and equally distributed to the front and rear wheels so that preferable characteristics of the four wheel driving are effected at the start of the vehicle and on rough roads. The present invention may be applied to motor vehicles having other engine and transmission arrangements than the illustrated embodiment or to a vehicle having an automatic transmission. The lock device 45 may be disposed between the hub 36 and the housing 37. Furthermore, the lock device 45 may be driven by a line pressure of the automatic transmission, or by an oil pressure applied by a pump driven by the engine. In accordance with the present invention, a viscous coupling provided in a power transmitting system is automatically locked when it is preferable to equally distribute the torque to four wheels of a vehicle. Thus, the durability of the viscous coupling and driveability on rough roads are improved and fuel consumption can be decreased. While the presently preferred embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described, it is to be understood that this disclosure is for the purpose of illustration and that various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims. * * * * *",

Description BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a hydraulic control system for a continuously variable belt-drive automatic transmission for a motor vehicle having a torque converter provided with a lockup clutch, and more particularly to a system for controlling the lockup clutch and line pressure in a hydraulic circuit for the transmission. In a continuously variable transmission provided with a torque converter, torque transmitted to the transmission is multiplied by the torque converter. On the other hand, when a lockup clutch provided in the torque converter is engaged, the engine torque is directly transmitted without multiplying. In order to prevent slipping of the belt on the pulleys, the line pressure which is controlled in dependency on the transmitted torque is regulated either for the lockup state or for the torque converter operating state. Japanese Patent Laid Open 57-161360 (U.S. Pat. No. 4,478,105) discloses a system in which pressure of oil from an oil pump is adjusted by a line pressure control valve for controlling drive and driven pulleys of the transmission. The line pressure control valve produces a control pressure for controlling a torque converter, a lockup clutch, a lockup control valve, and a clutch for a selector device. As the pressure in a drive pulley cylinder increases after the starting of the changing of the transmission ratio, a release side oil chamber of the torque converter is drained to engage the lockup clutch. During the release of the lockup clutch, the pressure applied to the release side oil chamber is applied to the line pressure control valve to increase the line pressure. However, in the control system, since the lockup clutch is controlled by the pressure applied to the drive pulley, the torque converter can be locked only after the start of the changing of the transmission ratio. Accordingly, when the rotational speed of the drive pulley is decreased, the lockup clutch is disengaged although the lockup of the torque converter may be preferable for the driving condition. Accordingly, the lockup range decreases. Additionally, the oil in the release side chamber is applied to the line pressure control valve in order to control the line pressure. However, the oil in the release side flows constantly, so that the pressure thereof is subject to vary. Thus, the line pressure cannot be increased with accuracy. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An object of the present invention is to provide a hydraulic control system where a lockup clutch of a torque converter is appropriately controlled. Another object of the present invention is to accurately control the line pressure in accordance with the operating conditions of the torque converter. The other objects and features of this invention will become understood from the following description with reference to the accompanying drawings . BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS FIGS. 1a and 1b show a sectional view of a continuously variable belt-drive transmission to which the present invention is applied; FIGS. 2a and 2b show a hydraulic control circuit according to the present invention; FIGS. 3a and 3b show a main portion of the hydraulic circuit; and FIG. 4 is a graph showing line pressure characteristic. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT FIGS. 1a and 1b show a four-wheel drive power transmission system with a continuously variable belt-drive automatic transmission for a motor vehicle, to which the present invention is applied. An engine E is transversely mounted on a motor vehicle at a front portion thereof. The power transmission system comprises a torque converter device 10, a selector device 30, a continuously variable belt-drive transmission 40, a final reduction and differential device 50, and a transfer device 60. The torque converter device 10 is provided in a housing 1. The selector device 30, transmission 40, final reduction device 50 and transfer device 60 are provided in a main housing 2 and a side housing 3. An extension case 4 is secured to the housing 1. The torque converter device 10 has a torque converter 14 with a lockup clutch 19. A drive plate 12 is fixed to a crankshaft 11 of the engine E. A converter cover 13 is secured to the drive plate 12. The torque converter 14 comprises an impeller 14a integral with the converter cover 13 by welding, a turbine 14b fixed to a turbine hub 16 which is splined to an input shaft 15, and a stator 14c connected to a hollow stator shaft 18 through a one-way clutch 17. The lockup clutch 19 is disposed between the converter cover 13 and the torque converter 14, and a facing 20 of the lockup clutch 19 is attached for making contact with the cover 13. Further, in the torque converter device 10, a release side oil chamber 21 is defined adjacent the converter cover 13 for applying release pressure to the lockup clutch 19, and an apply side oil chamber 22 is formed adjacent the torque converter 14 for applying lockup pressure to the lockup clutch 19. The selector device 30 comprises a planetary gear 31 having a pair of pinions 33 and 34, and a sun gear 32 mounted on the input shaft 15. Pinions 33 and 34 are supported on a carrier 35. The sun gear 32 is engaged with a ring gear 36 through pinions 33 and 34. A forward clutch 37 is disposed between the sun gear 32 and the ring gear 36. A reverse brake 8 is disposed between the ring gear 36 and the main case 2. At forward driving such as during selection of a drive range (d), the forward clutch 37 is engaged to lock the sun gear 32. At reverse driving, the reverse brake 38 is engaged to lock the ring gear 36 for reversely rotating the carrier 35. If the number of teeth of the ring gear 36 is determined to be twice as many as that of the sun gear 32, the a gear ratio at the reverse driving is equal to that at the forward driving. The belt-drive transmission 40 has a main shaft 41 engaged with the carrier 35 and an output shaft 42 provided in parallel with the main shaft 41. A drive pulley (primary pulley) 43 and a driven pulley (secondary pulley) 44 are mounted on the main shaft 41 and output shaft 42, respectively. A fixed conical disc 43a of the drive pulley 43 is integral with the main shaft 41 and an axially movable conical disc 43b is axially slidably mounted on the main shaft 41. The movable conical disc 43b also slides in a cylinder 46 formed on the main shaft 41 to provide a servo device. A fixed conical disc 44a of the driven pulley 44 is formed on the output shaft 42 opposite the movable conical disc 43b and a movable conical disc 44b is slidably mounted on the shaft 42 opposite the disc 43a. The movable conical disc 44b has a cylindrical portion which is slidably engaged in a cylinder 47 of the output shaft 42 to form a servo device. A spring 48 is provided to urge the movable conical disc 44b toward the fixed conical disc 44a. A drive belt 45 engages with the drive pulley 43 and the driven pulley 44. The cylinder 46 of the drive pulley 43 is so designed that the pressure receiving area thereof is larger than that of the cylinder 47 of the driven pulley 44. Thus, the running diameter of the belt 45 on the pulleys is varied dependent on driving conditions. Secured to the output shaft 42 is a drive gear 51a of the final reduction device 50 which engages with an intermediate reduction gear 51 on an intermediate shaft 52. An intermediate gear 53 on the shaft 52 engages with a final reduction gear 54. The rotation of the final reduction gear 54 is transmitted to axles 56 of front driving wheels of the vehicle through a differential 55. The transfer device 60 comprises a transfer gear 61 engaged with the final reduction gear 54 and rotatably mounted on a transfer shaft 62 which is transversely disposed and rotatably supported by bearings, and a transfer clutch 63 in the form of a fluid operated multiple-disk friction clutch. The transfer clutch 63 operates to couple the gear 61 with the shaft 62, so that the rotation of the gear 61 is transferred to rear drive wheels of the vehicle through shaft 62, bevel gear 64a secured to the shaft 62, bevel gear 64 engaged with the bevel gear 64a and rear drive shaft 65. In the side housing 3, an oil pump 70 is provided for supplying a high pressure of oil for the transmission. The main shaft 41 has an axial passage in which an oil pump driving shaft 71 connected to the crankshaft 11 is rotatably mounted. An oil pump 72 for the torque converter device 10 is provided for supplying a low pressure of oil and housed in a pump housing 73 and a cover 74 at the rear end of the housing 1. A pump drive shaft 75 is connected to the impeller 14a and is operatively connected with a rotor of the oil pump 72. Thus, the oil pump 70 is disposed adjacent the transmission 40, and the oil pump 72 is disposed adjacent the torque converter device 10. Referring to FIGS. 2a and 2b, showing a hydraulic control circuit, oil in an oil reservoir 80 is supplied to a line pressure control valve 100 through a line pressure passage 81 by the pump 70. An oil passage 82 connected to the passage 81 is communicated with the cylinder 47 of the driven pulley 44. The passage 81 is further communicated with a transmission ratio control valve 110 through a passage 83. The cylinder 46 of drive pulley 43 is applied with pressurized oil passing through the passage 81, passage 83, transmission ratio control valve 110, and a passage 84. A passage 140 connected to the oil pump 72 is communicated with a passage 85. The pressure of oil supplied to the passage 85 is regulated by a pair of relief valves 150 and 160 to produce a low actuating pressure. The passage 85 is connected to a drain port of the line pressure control valve 100. A part of the oil in the passage 85 is supplied to the driven pulley 44 from a nozzle 87 passing through a passage 86 to lubricate the pulley device. The passage 86 is further communicated with a passage 89 through a check valve 88. The passage 89 is communicated with a lubricating oil tube on which a transmission ratio sensing shoe 90 is slidably mounted. The passage 85 is communicated with a reducing valve 120 for providing a constant reducing pressure of oil. A conduit 91a is communicated with the line pressure control valve 100 through a passage 107. The conduit 91a is also communicated with a solenoid operated on-off valve 109 and with an accumulator 108. Further, a conduit 91 is communicated with the transmission ratio control valve 110 through a passage 92 and with a solenoid operated on-off valve 119. The solenoid operated valve 109 is adapted to be operated by duty signals for producing control pressure in the form of pulses and the control pressure is applied to the line pressure control valve 100. Further, the line pressure control valve 100 is applied with signals dependent on the transmission ratio from the sensing shoe 90 and on oil pressure through a passage 93 in accordance with conditions of the torque converter, so that the line pressure is controlled in accordance with the transmission ratio, engine torque, and torque multiplying factor of the torque converter. The solenoid operated valve 119 is also operated by duty signals and produces control pressure which is applied to the transmission ratio control valve 110 for shifting a spool of the valve 110 to an oil supply position and an oil drain position by the degree of duty cycle. The control pressure increases upon off state of the duty signal and reduces on state of the duty signal. Thus, the flow rate of oil supplied to or drained from the cylinder 46 of drive pulley 43 is controlled to provide optimum transmission ratio. A drain passage 118 from the transmission ratio control valve 110 is communicated with the oil reservoir 80 through a check valve 117. A prefill passage 116 is provided between the passage 85 and a position upstream of the check valve 117. Thus, oil is supplied to the cylinder 46 of the drive pulley 43, even if the transmission ratio control valve 110 is in the drain state, thereby improving starting characteristic. The passage 85 is communicated with the transfer control valve 130, and a solenoid operated valve 139 for the transfer control valve 130 is communicated with the reducing valve 120 through a passage 94. The solenoid operated valve 139 actuates the transfer control valve 130 to produce clutch actuating pressure which is supplied to the transfer clutch 63 through a passage 138 for controlling clutch torque dependent on driving conditions. The passage 140 is communicated with the lockup control valve 170. The lockup control valve 170 is communicated with the torque converter 14 through a passage 141 and the release side oil chamber 21 of the lockup clutch 19 through a passage 142. A relief valve 143 is provided on the passage 141 for preventing increase of pressure in the torque converter 14 when the torque converter is locked up. A drain passage 144 of the lockup control valve 170 is communicated with the oil reservoir 80 through a check valve 145 and an oil cooler 146. The lockup control valve 170 is communicated with the reducing valve 120 through passages 95, 92 and 91 for supplying with the reducing pressure as a controlled oil pressure to the lockup control valve 170. The reducing pressure is also supplied to the passage 93 communicated with the line pressure control valve 100 and to a solenoid operated on-off valve 179. The solenoid operated valve 179 controls the controlled oil pressure so as to produce converter condition pressure P.sub.R in the passage 93 operate the lockup control valve 170 to communicate the passage 140 with the passage 141 or the passage 142. The passage 140 is further communicated with a safety lock valve 180 which is connected to a selector valve 190 through a passage 147. The selector valve 190 is provided for selectively connecting passages in accordance with operations of a selector lever for selecting operational ranges such as a parking range (P), reverse range (R), neutral range (N), and drive range (D). The selector valve 190 is communicated with the forward clutch 37 through a passage 148 and with the reverse brake 38 through a passage 149. The safety lock valve 180 has a solenoid operated on-off valve 189 which is supplied with the reducing pressure of the reducing valve 120 through passage 95 to forcibly drain the oil in the forward clutch 37 or the reverse brake 38 to disengage the transmission. The lockup control valve 170 and the line pressure control valve 100 are described in detail with reference to FIG. 3. The lockup control valve 170 comprises a valve body 171, a spool 172 and a spring 175 for urging the spool to the left. A port 171a which is communicated with the passage 140 is selectively communicated with a port 171b or a port 171c in accordance with the position of lands of spool 172. The ports 171b and 171c communicate with the passages 141 and the passage 142, respectively. Drain ports 171d and 171e, each communicated with the drain passage 144, are provided to selectively communicate with the ports 171b or 171c, respectively. An end chamber 171f and an end chamber 171g formed at opposite ends of the spool are communicated with the oil passage 95 through passages 173 and 174, respectively, so as to be applied with the reducing pressure from the reducing valve 120. The chamber 171g is also communicated with the solenoid operated on-off valve 79 and with the passage 93 communicated with the line pressure control valve 100. The spool 172 is so designed that a pressure receiving area thereof is smaller at the chamber 171f than at the chamber 171g. Accordingly, when the reducing pressure is equally applied to both chambers through the passage 95, the spool 172 is shifted to the left by the large pressure applied to the chamber 171g. The solenoid operated on-off valve 179 is provided to be turned off to drain the oil. When the valve 179 is turned on to close the valve, the reducing pressure is applied to the end chamber 171g so that the spool 172 is shifted to the left, thereby communicating the port 171a with the port 171c. Accordingly, the pressurized oil is supplied to the torque converter 14 through the passages 140, 142 and the release side oil chamber 21. The port 171b is communicated with the drain port 171d so that the oil in the torque converter 14 is drained to the oil reservoir 80 through the passage 141, 144 and the oil cooler 146. Accordingly, the lockup clutch 19 is released so that torque converter 14 is operated to multiply the torque. On the other hand, when the solenoid operated valve 179 is turned off to open the valve, the oil in the chamber 171g is drained. The spool 172 is shifted to the right to the position shown in FIG. 3. Thus, the port 171a is communicated with the port 171b and the port 171c is communicated with the port 171e, thereby supplying oil to the apply side oil chamber 22 through the passage 141, and draining the oil in the release side oil chamber 21 of the lockup clutch 19 through the passage 142. Accordingly, the facing 20 comes in contact with the converter cover 13 to engage the lockup clutch 19. The relief valve 143 in the passage 141 maintains the pressure of oil in the torque converter 14 while the clutch is locked. When the solenoid operated valve 179 is closed, the reducing pressure is applied to the line pressure control valve 100 through the passage 93 as a converter condition pressure. The line pressure control valve 100 comprises a valve body 101, spool 102, and ports 101a, 101b, 101c, 101d and 101e. The line pressure control valve 100 has an axially slidable spring retainer 103 and a spring 104 provided between the spool 102 and the retainer 103. The transmission ratio sensing shoe 90 engages with the retainer 103. The ports 101a and 101d are supplied with the pressurized oil through the line pressure passage 81 from the pump 70. A land 102a of the spool 102 is arranged to control the communication between the port 101d and the drain port 101e to as to control the line pressure. The port 101c is applied with the reducing pressure (converter condition pressure) P.sub.R representing the operating condition of the torque converter through the passage 93, and the port 101b is applied with an actuating pressure P.sub.C determined by the solenoid operated valve 109. In the line pressure control valve 100, the relationship among spring load F, line pressure P.sub.L, actuating pressure P.sub.C at the port 101b, reducing pressure P.sub.R, line pressure receiving area S.sub.L of the spool at the port 101a, actuating pressure receiving area S.sub.C at the port 101b and reducing pressure receiving area S.sub.R at the port 101c is as follows. When the lockup clutch 19 of the torque converter is engaged, since the solenoid operated valve 179 is open, the reducing pressure is not applied to the port 101c of the line pressure control valve (P.sub.R =0). Accordingly, the line pressure is controlled in accordance with the spring force F which is dependent on the transmission ratio and the actuating pressure P.sub.C which is dependent on the engine power. Thus, as shown in the graph of FIG. 4, the line pressure increases as the opening degree of the throttle valve increases and decreases as the transmission is upshifted (small transmission pulley ratio). On the other hand, when the torque converter 14 is operated, the reducing pressure P.sub.R (as converter condition pressure) is applied to the port 101c, thereby increasing the line pressure P.sub.L. Therefore, the line pressure P.sub.L in the torque converter operating range becomes larger than in the lockup range as shown in FIG. 4 so as to prevent the belt from slipping on the pulleys. Describing the operation of the system, the system supplies pulse signals to the solenoid operated valves 109, 119, 139, 179 and 189 to operate them at duty cycles dependent on driving conditions. When the engine starts, the oil pumps 70 and 72 are driven to supply oil to the system. The high line pressure is supplied by the oil pump 70 to the passage 81 and controlled by the line pressure control valve 100. The cylinder 47 of the driven pulley 44 is supplied with the line pressure adjusted by the line pressure control valve 100 through the passages 81, 82. Thus, the continuously variable transmission 40 provides the largest transmission ratio at low engine speed stage. On the other hand, a low actuating pressure of oil adjusted by the relief valves 150 and 160 is supplied to passages 140 and 85. From the low actuating pressure, the reducing valve 120 produces a reducing pressure which is applied to solenoid operated valves 119, 139, 179 and 189. The low actuating pressure is supplied to the transfer control valve 130 through the passage 85 to produce the clutch actuating pressure which is supplied to the transfer clutch 63. The actuating pressure is also supplied to the lockup control valve 170 through the passage 140. At starting of the vehicle, the passage 140 is communicated with the passage 142 by the operation of the solenoid operated valve 179. Thus, the pressure of oil is applied to the torque converter 14 through the release side oil chamber 21 and drained to the oil reservoir 80 through the passages 141 and 144. The lockup clutch 19 is disengaged and the torque converter 14 is in operating state. In a normal state, the safety lock valve 180 operates to communicate the passage 140 with the passage 147 by the solenoid operated valve 189, so that the selector valve 190 is supplied with the actuating pressure. When the P or N range is selected at starting, oil in the forward clutch 37 and the reverse brake 38 are drained. Thus, the planetary gear 31 is released to disengage the transmission 40. When the D range is selected, the actuating pressure is applied to the forward clutch 37 to lock the planetary gear 31, so that the input shaft 15 is engaged with the main shaft 41. Thus, the torque converter 14 operates to transmit the power of the engine to the automatic transmission 40. The power of the engine is transmitted to the output shaft 42 at the largest transmission ratio by the driving belt 45 and pulleys 43, 44, and further transmitted to axles of the driving wheels through the final reduction device 50. Thus, the vehicle is started. In this state, converter condition pressure P.sub.R is supplied to the line pressure control valve 100 by the operation of the lockup solenoid 179 through the passage 93 to increase the line pressure. The torque converter 14 multiplies the torque in accordance with the speed, and the multiplied torque is transmitted through the transmission 40 without slipping of the belt 45 due to the high line pressure. After starting of the vehicle, when the torque converter 14 becomes a condition for a lockup range, and the solenoid operated valve 179 is turned off, the oil in the release side chamber 21 is drained through the passage 142 so that lockup clutch 19 is pushed by the oil pressure in the apply side chamber 22. Thus, the facing 20 comes in contact with the converter cover 13 to lock the crankshaft 11 and the lockup clutch 19, which means locking of the torque converter 14. Therefore, the engine power can be transmitted to the input shaft 15 through the lockup clutch 19. In this state, converter pressure in the passage 93 becomes zero, so that the line pressure is controlled by the line pressure control valve 100 without the torque multiplying factor, thereby preventing the line pressure supplied to the pulleys from exceeding. The transmission ratio control valve 110 is operated by solenoid valve 119, for controlling the pressure applied to the cylinder 46 of the drive pulley 43. Thus, the transmission ratio is controlled at a predetermined transmission ratio changing speed. When the R range is selected, the reverse brake 38 is supplied with the actuating pressure of oil to reversely rotate the carrier 35 for providing reverse driving. In order to prevent a shock which occurs when the torque converter 14 is locked, the solenoid operated valve 179 may be modified so as to be operated dependent on a duty cycle, thereby gradually increasing the actuating pressure applied to the apply side chamber 22. In the modification, an additional solenoid operated on-off valve is further provided between the passages 93 and 95 for controlling the reducing pressure (converter condition pressure) P.sub.R applied to the line pressure control valve 100. In another modification, a check valve and an orifice may be provided in the passage 93 so as to decrease the flow rate of the oil to the line pressure control valve 100. Thus, a shock which occurs at the increase of the line pressure when the transmission is downshifted can be restrained. In accordance with the present invention, the lockup clutch of the torque converter is operated by the solenoid operated valve so that the clutch is locked without delay at appropriate driving conditions, for example at the start of the changing of the transmission ratio. Thus, the lockup of the torque converter is effectively performed. Since a predetermined reducing pressure is applied to the line pressure control valve as a converter condition pressure, the line pressure can be accurately increased in accordance with the increase of the torque by the torque converter. The supply of the reducing pressure to the line pressure control valve is easily controlled by the solenoid operated valve without response delay. Since hydraulic circuits supplying different levels of oil pressure are respectively provided for the transmission and the torque converter, the control thereof is performed without affecting each other. While the presently preferred embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described, it is to be understood that this disclosure is for the purpose of illustration and that various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims. * * * * *",

Description BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a system for transmitting the power of an engine to four driving wheels of a four-wheel drive vehicle. In a conventional four-wheel drive vehicle having a central differential, which is called a full time four-wheel drive vehicle, the central differential operates to uniformly distribute the torque of an engine to front wheels and to rear wheels of the vehicle. It is known that the distribution ratio of torque influences driveability, steerability, stability, starting characteristic and other factors. Namely, when the distribution to the front wheel is increased, a stable cornering characteristic at high vehicle speed is established, and when the distribution to the rear wheels is increased, steerability at low vehicle speed is improved. In the conventional four-wheel drive vehicle, the distribution ratio of torque to the front wheels and to the rear wheels can not be changed. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The object of the present invention is to provide a system which may change the distribution ratio of torque to front wheels and rear wheels in accordance with driving conditions of a four-wheel drive vehicle. The other objects and features of this invention will become understood from the following description with reference to the accompanying drawings .

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS FIG. 1 shows a power transmission system for a four-wheel drive motor vehicle to which the present invention is applied. An engine 1 is longitudinally mounted on the motor vehicle at a front portion thereof, thus forming a transaxle type. The power transmission system housed in a transmission case comprises a clutch 2, transmission 4 and transfer device 18. The transmission 4 has an input shaft 3, a tubular output shaft 5 parallel with the input shaft 3, four pairs of change-speed gears 6 to 9 corresponding to first to fourth speed gears, and synchronizers 10 and 11. The synchronizers 10 and 11 are disposed between the gears 6 and 7 and between 8 and 9, respectively. A reverse drive gear 12 mounted on the input shaft 3 meshes with a gear 13 formed on one side of a sleeve of the synchronizer 10 through an idler gear (not shown) for reverse drive. A front drive shaft 14 is rotatably supported in the output shaft 5 and by a bearing. A drive pinion 15 at the front end of the shaft 14 meshes with a crown gear 17 of a front differential 16 so as to transmit the power to front wheels of the vehicle. In a transfer device 18 disposed behind the transmission, a rear drive shaft 19 is disposed parallel to the front drive shaft 14. The rear drive shaft 19 is connected to rear wheels of the vehicle through a propeller shaft 20 and a rear differential 21. The shaft 19 is supported by bearings. The transfer device 18 has a central differential comprising first and second planetary gear devices 24, 25 disposed in series on the front drive shaft 14 and a viscous coupling 28. The planetary gear device 24 comprises a sun gear 24b and planet pinions 24a in mesh with the gear 24b. The second planetary gear device 25 comprises a sun gear 25b, a ring gear 25c having internal teeth and planet pinions 25a. The corresponding planet pinions 24a and 25a of the first and second planetary gear devices are connected with each other by rods 26. The rods 26 are rotatably supported in a carrier 27 which is connected with the output shaft 5. The sun gear 24b is connected to a gear 31 through a tubular shaft 24c. The gear 31 is in mesh with a gear 32 rotatably mounted on the rear drive shaft 19. Mounted on the front drive shaft 14 at the output side of the second planetary gear device 25 is the viscous coupling 28. The viscous coupling 28 comprises a housing 28a having a plurality of outer disks 28d, a hub 28b rotatably mounted on the front drive shaft 14 and having a plurality of inner disks 28e, and a high viscous fluid contained in the housing 28a. The disks are alternately arranged in the axial direction of the coupling 28. The housing 28a is connected to the ring gear 25c of the second planetary gear device 25 through a tubular shaft 25d and the hub 28b is connected to the sun gear 25b. When there is a speed difference between the housing 28a and the hub 28b, the viscous coupling operates to generate torque in dependency on the difference. Thus, the torque is transmitted from a higher speed disk side to a lower speed disk side. Change-over coupling devices 29 and 30 are provided on the front and rear drive shafts 14 and 19, respectively. The change-over coupling device 29 comprises a selector sleeve 29a and five gears 29b.sub.1 to 29b.sub.5. The gears 29b.sub.1 and 29b.sub.2 are securely mounted on a tubular shaft 28c which is integral with the housing 28a of the viscous coupling 28. The gears 29b.sub.3 and 29b.sub.4 are securely mounted on the hub 28b. The gear 29b.sub.5 is securely mounted on the front drive shaft 14. The selector sleeve 29a has inner teeth 29a.sub.1 selectively capable of meshing with the gear 29b.sub.1 or with 29b.sub.2, has inner teeth 29a.sub.2 selectively capable of meshing with the gear 29b.sub.3 or with 29b.sub.4, and inner teeth 29a.sub.3 selectively capable of meshing with the gear 29b.sub.5. The second change-over coupling device 30 comprises a selector sleeve 30a, gear 30b.sub.1 integral with the gear 32, a gear 30b.sub.2 securely mounted on the rear drive shaft 19 and a gear 30b.sub.3 integral with a gear 34 which in turn meshes with a gear 33 fixedly mounted on the shaft 25d. The selector sleeve 30a has internal teeth 30a.sub.1, 30a.sub.2 and 30a.sub.3 which selectively mesh with the gears 30b.sub.1, 30b.sub.2 and 30b.sub.3, respectively. A selector lever 38, which can be shifted to positions I to V depending on the driving conditions or at the preference of the driver, is provided so as to change the positions of the selector sleeve 29a and 30a through a rod 37 having a fork 37a for the sleeve 29a and a fork 37b for the sleeve 30a. The power of the engine 1 is transmitted to the transmission 4 through the clutch 2 and the input shaft 3 and further to the carrier 27 of the first and second planetary gear devices 24, 25 in the transfer device 18. The torque is transmitted to the front wheels through a front power path of the transfer device 18 comprising the second planetary gear device 25, first change-over device 29, front drive shaft 14 and front differential 16. The torque is transmitted to the second change-over device 30 either through the first planetary gear device 24 and gears 31, 32 or through the second planetary gear device 25 and gears 33, 34. The torque is further transmitted to the rear wheels through rear drive shaft 19, propeller shaft 20 and rear differential 21. These members comprise a rear power path of the transfer device 18 for transmitting the output power of the transmission 4 to the rear wheels. The operation of the present system is described hereinafter with reference to FIGS. 2a to 2e and to FIG. 3. When the selector lever 38 is at the position I, the gear 30b.sub.1 and the gear 30b.sub.3 do not engage with teeth 30a.sub.1 and 30a.sub.3 of the selector sleeve 30a as shown in FIG. 2a so that the torque is not transmitted to the rear wheels. Thus, the output torque T of the transmission 4 is entirely transmitted to the front wheels as front torque T.sub.F (T.sub.F =T). Accordingly, two-wheel driving is established thereby providing driving stability at high vehicle speed. At the position I, since the gear 29b.sub.1 meshes with the internal teeth 29a.sub.1 and gear 29b.sub.3 meshes with teeth 29a.sub.2, the first change-over coupling device 29 operates to directly connect the housing 28a of the coupling 28 with the hub 28b and to connect the sun gear 25b with the ring gear 25c to lock the differential mechanism. Accordingly, the coupling 28 and the second planetary gear device are inoperative. When the selector lever 38 is at position II, selector sleeves 29a and 30a are at the position shown in FIG. 2b. Consequently, the front torque T.sub.F is transmitted to the front drive shaft 14 through the output shaft 5, carrier 27, planet pinions 25a, ring gear 25c, housing 28a, gear 29b.sub.1, internal teeth 29a.sub.1, 29a.sub.3 and the gear 29b.sub.5. The rear torque T.sub.R is transmitted to the rear drive shaft 19 through carrier 27, planet pinions 24a and sun gear 24b of the first planetary gear device 24, gears 31, 32, gear 30b.sub.1, internal teeth 30a.sub.1, 30a.sub.2 and gear 30b.sub.2. The difference between the speed of the front and rear wheels is absorbed as the planet pinions 25a walk around the sun gear 25b and on the ring gear 25c. Thus, the planetary gear device 25 operates as a central differential. Accordingly, a full time four-wheel driving mode with the central differential function is established. Since the torque is transmitted to the to rear wheels and front wheels through the sun gear 24b and the ring gear 25c, respectively, the torque is distributed in accordance with the difference between the gear ratios of the sun gear 24b and the ring gear 25c (the diameter of the ring gear is larger than the sun gear). Therefore, the torque T.sub.F of the front wheels is larger than the torque T.sub.R of the rear wheels(T.sub.F >T.sub.R). When the front wheels, to which greater torque is transmitted, skid, the housing 28a operatively connected to the front wheels rotates faster than the hub 28b. The difference of the rotational speeds between inner disks 28e and outer disks 28d generates coupling torque T.sub.C which is transmitted to the lower speed side, namely, to the inner disks 28e. Thus, the rear torque becomes large (T.sub.R +T.sub.C) and the front torque T.sub.F temporarily reduces to T-(T.sub.R +T.sub.C) so that the vehicle can easily get out of a stuck state by the increased rear torque. When the lever 38 is shifted to the position III, as shown in FIG. 2c, the housing 28a and hub 28b of viscous coupling 28 are coupled by the respective engagement of the gears 29b.sub.1 and 29b.sub.4 with internal teeth 29a.sub.1 and 29a.sub.2 to lock the coupling as a differential mechanism. In the second planetary gear device 25, since the sun gear 25b and the ring gear 25c are coupled, torque is uniformly distributed to the front and rear wheels providing a four wheel driving (T.sub.F .apprxeq.T.sub.R). Since the gear 30b.sub.1 disengages with the internal teeth 30a.sub.1 and the gear 30b.sub.3 engages with the internal teeth 30a.sub.3, the torque T.sub.R is transmitted to the rear drive shaft 19 through the gears 33 and 34. Thus, driveability on rough roads and stable driving on road having low coefficient of friction are improved. When the lever 38 is further shifted to the position IV, the viscous coupling 28 again becomes operative to enable a center differential action since the internal teeth 29a.sub.1 engages with neither gears 29b.sub.1, 29eb.sub.2 as shown in FIG. 2d. The front torque T.sub.F is transmitted to the front drive shaft 14 through the sun gear 25b of the second planetary gear device 25, hub 28b, gear 29b.sub.4, internal teeth 29a.sub.2 and 29a.sub.3 and gear 29b.sub.5. The rear torque T.sub.R is transmitted to the rear drive shaft 19 through the ring gear 25c, shaft 25d, gears 33, 34, gear 30b.sub.3, internal teeth 30a.sub.3, 30a.sub.2 and gear 30b.sub.2. Since the sun gear 25b is smaller than the ring gear 25c, the front torque T.sub.F is smaller than the rear torque T.sub.R (T.sub.F <T.sub.R), thereby improving cornering power and starting characteristic. If the rear wheels skid under the present condition, the front torque is increased similarly as described in the case of position II. When the selector lever 38 is shifted to the position V the rod 37 is moved to the position shown in FIG. 2e. Since the gear 29b.sub.5 and teeth 29a of the sleeve 29a are disengaged, torque is not transmitted to the front wheels. As a result, the entire torque T is transmitted to the rear drive shaft 19 through the ring gear 25c, shaft 25d, gears 33, 34, gear 30b.sub.3, internal teeth 30a.sub.2 and gear 30b.sub.2. Accordingly, cornering power of the vehicle is improved. FIG. 3 shows the above-described coupling states and torque distribution. Referring to FIG. 4 showing a transfer device of the second embodiment of the present invention, the construction is the same as the first embodiment but for the disposition of the viscous coupling 28. The same parts as the first embodiment are identified with the same references as FIG. 1. The viscous coupling 28 in the present embodiment is disposed on the rear drive shaft 19 at the output side of the second change-over device 30. The inner disks 28e are directly secured to the rear drive shaft 19 which serves as hub 28b of FIG. 1. The housing 28a having outer disks 28c is integral with a gear 36 which meshes with a gear 35 securely mounted on the front drive shaft 14. Consequently, the ring gear 25c of the second planetary gear device 25 is directly connected with the gears 29b.sub.1 and 29b.sub.2 and sun gear 25b is connected to the gears 29b.sub.3 and 29b.sub.4 through a tubular shaft 25e. The torque is transmitted to the front wheels and to the rear wheels in the same manner as in the first embodiment through the respective front and rear power paths of the transfer device. The operation of the system in the second embodiment is described in the table of FIG. 5, and the positions of the selector sleeves 29a and 30a of the first and second change-over coupling devices 29 and 30 at positions I to V are the same as those shown in FIGS. 2a to 2e. At position I of the selector lever 38, the rod 37 is at a position most to the left so that the internal teeth 29a.sub.1, 29a.sub.2, 29a.sub.3 engages the gears 29b.sub.1, 29b.sub.3 and 29b.sub.5, respectively, in the first change-over coupling device 29, and the internal teeth 30a.sub.2 engage the gear 30b.sub.2 in the second change-over coupling device 30. Accordingly, the ring gear 25c and the sun gear 25b are coupled to lock the second planetary gear device 25. Since neither of the gears 30b.sub.1, 30b.sub.3 is in engagement with the selector sleeve 30a, torque is not transmitted to the rear wheels. Thus, torque T is transmitted only to the front drive shaft 14 through the second planetary gear device 25 and the first change-over coupling device 29 (T.sub.F =T). When the front wheels skid causing the front drive shaft 14 to idly rotate at high speed, the viscous coupling 28 operates to apply a part of the front torque to the rear drive shaft 19 depending on the speed difference between the housing 28a and the rear drive shaft 19. Thus, the vehicle is temporarily in four wheel driving state to stop the skidding of the front wheels. When the lever 38 is a the position II as shown in FIG. 2b, neither gear 29b.sub.3 nor the gear 29b.sub.4, both of which are connected with the sun gear 25b of the second planetary gear device 25, is engaged with the sleeve 29a. Thus, the front torque T.sub.F is transmitted to the front drive shaft 14 through the ring gear 25c, gear 29a.sub.1, internal teeth 29a.sub.1, 29a.sub.3 and gear 29b.sub.5. The rear torque T.sub.R is transmitted to the rear drive shaft 19 through the planet pinions 24a, sun gear 24b of the first planetary gear device 24, gears 31, 32, gear 30b.sub.1, internal teeth 30a.sub.1, 30a.sub.2 and gear 30b.sub.2. Since the ring gear 25c is larger than the sun gear 24b, the front torque T.sub.F is larger than the rear torque T.sub.R (T.sub.F >T.sub.R) The viscous coupling 28 operates in the same manner as before. At the position III, the shafts 25d and 25e are directly connected by the engagement of the gears 29b.sub.1 and 29b.sub.4 with internal teeth 29a.sub.1, 29a.sub.2, respectively, thereby coupling the sun gear 25b with the ring gear 25c. Thus, the front and rear torques are equal (T.sub.F .apprxeq.T.sub.R) Since the gear 30b.sub.3 engages the internal teeth 30a.sub.3, the rear torque T.sub.R is transmitted to the rear drive shaft 19 through the second planetary gear device 25, shaft 25e, gear 33, 34, gear 30b.sub.3, internal teeth 30a.sub.3, 30a.sub.2 and gear 30b.sub.2. During such a condition, the rotational speed of the housing 28a of the coupling 28 which is rotated with the drive shaft 14 through gears 35, 36 is the same as that of the rear drive shaft 19. Consequently, the coupling 28 is inoperative. At the position IV, the front torque T.sub.F is transmitted to the front drive shaft 14 through the sun gear 25b, and the gear 29b.sub.4 and the rear torque T.sub.R is transmitted to the rear drive shaft 19 through the ring gear 25c, gears 33, 34 and coupling device 30. The front torque T.sub.F is smaller than the rear torque (T.sub.F <T.sub.R) because of the gear ratio between the sun and ring gears 25b and 25c. When the lever 38 is shifted to the position V, the gear 29b is disengaged from the selector sleeve 29a. The engagements of the gear 29b.sub.2 with the internal teeth 29a.sub.1 and the gear 29b.sub.3 with teeth 29a.sub.2 couple the sun gear 25b and the ring gear 25c to lock the second planetary gear device 25. Accordingly, the entire torque T is transmitted to the rear wheels as the rear torque T.sub.R (T.sub.R =T). Referring to FIG. 6, the third embodiment of the present invention is applied to a motor vehicle having a laterally mounted engine. An output shaft 41 through which torque T of a transmission is transmitted is provided with a gear 45 securely mounted thereon. The gear 45 is in mesh with a gear 46 which in turn meshes with a gear 47 fixedly mounted on a transfer shaft 44 of the transfer device supported in a transmission case by bearings. The output of the transmission is transmitted to the front and rear wheels of the vehicle by front and rear power paths of the transfer device. First and second planetary gear devices 49 and 50 of the transfer device are mounted on the transfer shaft 44 and housed in a housing 52. The first planetary gear device 49 comprises a planet pinions 49a, a sun gear 49b and a ring gear 49c integral with housing 52. The second planetary gear device 50 comprises planet pinions 50a, a sun gear 50b and a ring gear 50c which is integral with the housing 52. A common carrier 51 for the two planetary gear devices 49 and 50 is fixedly mounted on the transfer shaft 44. A viscous coupling 55 of the transfer device disposed on the transfer shaft 44 comprises a hub 55b having inner disks 55d and a housing 55a having outer disks 55c. The hub 55b is connected with the sun gear 50b of the second planetary gear device 50 and the housing 55a is connected with the housing 52 of the planetary gear devices. A first change-over coupling device 53 has a selector sleeve 53a having internal teeth 53a.sub.1, 53a.sub.2, 53a.sub.3 and gear 53b.sub.1, 53b.sub.2, 53b.sub.3. The gear 53b.sub.3 is connected with the housing 52 and the gear 53b.sub.2 with the sun gear 49b of the first planetary gear device 49. The gear 53b.sub.1 is integral with a gear 56 which meshes with a gear 47 secured to a case of a front differential 48. The front differential 48 has front axles 42a, 42b for transmitting front torque T.sub.F to right and left front wheels (T.sub.FL +T.sub.FR =T.sub.F). A second change-over coupling device 54 is provided adjacent the coupling 55 on the transfer shaft 44. The second change-over coupling device 54 comprises a selector sleeve 54a and five gears 54b.sub.1 to 54b.sub.5. The gear 54b.sub.1 and 54b.sub.2 are integral with the housing 55a of the viscous coupling 55 and the gear 54b.sub.3 and 54b.sub.4 are fixedly mounted on the extension of the hub 55b. The gear 54b.sub.5 is secured to a bevel gear 58a which meshes with a bevel gear 58b formed on a rear drive shaft 43 connected with a propeller shaft for transmitting rear torque T.sub.R to rear wheels. The selector sleeves 53a and 54a of the change-over coupling devices 53, 54 are moved by the operation of the selector lever 60. The lever 60 is connected with a rod 59 having forks 59a and 59b respectively engaged with the sleeves 53a and 54a. The lever is selectively shifted to positions I to V depending on the driving conditions. Torque T from the output shaft 41 is transmitted through gears 45, 46 and 47 and transfer shaft 44 to the first and second planetary gear devices 49 and 50 where the torque is distributed to the first and second change-over coupling devices 53 and 54 for the front and rear wheels, respectively. The operation of the power transmitting system in the third embodiment is described hereinafter with reference to FIGS. 7a to 7e and 8. When the selector lever 60 is at the position I as shown in FIG. 7a, internal teeth 53a.sub.1 and 53a.sub.3 are engaged with the gears 53b.sub.1 and 53b.sub.3, respectively. Thus, torque T.sub.F is transmitted to the differential 48 through the transfer shaft 44, carrier 51, planet pinions 49a, ring gear 49c, housing 52, gear 52b.sub.3, internal teeth 53a, 53a and gear 53b.sub.1, and gear 56 and 57. The gear 54b.sub.5 is disengaged from the sleeve 54a so that torque is not transmitted to the rear wheels. Thus, whole torque T is transmitted to the front wheel (T.sub.FL +T.sub.FR =T). On the other hand, since the gear 54b.sub.1 engages the internal teeth 54a.sub.1 and the gear 54b.sub.3 engages the teeth 54a.sub.2, the housing 55a and the hub 55b are coupled so as to prevent the relative rotation thereof, thereby rendering the coupling 55 inoperative. The first and second planetary gear devices are also locked. When the lever 60 is shifted to the position II, the front torque T.sub.F is transmitted to the differential 48 through planet pinions 49a, ring gear 49c, housing 52, gear 53b.sub.3, internal teeth 53a.sub.3, internal teeth 53a.sub.1 and gear 53b.sub.1. On the other hand, the rear torque is transmitted to the rear drive shaft 43 through the planet pinions 50a, sun gear 50b, hub 55b of the viscous coupling 55, gear 54b.sub.3, teeth 54a.sub.2 and 54a.sub.3, gear 54b.sub.5 and bevel gears 58.sub.a and 58b. In accordance with the difference between gear ratios of the ring gear 49c and sun gear 50b, the front torque T.sub.F is larger than the rear torque T.sub.R (T.sub.F >T.sub.R). During such a condition, the viscous coupling 55 is operative. At the position III, the sleeves 53a and 54a are further moved as shown in FIG. 7c. The internal teeth 54a.sub.1, 54a.sub.2 and 54a.sub.3 engage with gears 53b.sub.2, 54b.sub.3 and 54b.sub.5, respectively, so that the viscous coupling 55 and the first and second planetary gear device 50 are locked. Thus, the front differential 48 and the rear drive shaft 43 are directly connected so that the torque T is uniformly distributed to the front and rear wheels (T.sub.F .apprxeq.T.sub.R). In FIG. 7d, the lever 60 is shifted to the position IV to release the engagement of the internal teeth 54a.sub.2 with gear 54b.sub.3, thereby rendering the viscous coupling 55 operative. The front torque T.sub.F is transmitted to the front wheels through the carrier 51, planet pinions 49a, sun gear 49b, gear 53b.sub.2, internal teeth 53a.sub.2 and 53a.sub.1 and gear 53b.sub.1. On the other hand, the rear torque T.sub.R is transmitted to the rear drive shaft 43 through the carrier 51, planet pinions 50a, ring gear 50c, housing 52, gears 54b.sub.2, internal teeth 54a.sub.1, 54a.sub.3 and gear 54b.sub.5. Since the ring gear 50c is larger than sun gear 49b, the rear torque T.sub.R is larger than the front torque T.sub.F (T.sub.F >T.sub.R) The coupling 55 is operative during the condition. In the position V shown in FIG. 7e, neither the gear 53b.sub.2 nor the gear 53b.sub.3 engages with the selector sleeve 53a so that torque is not transmitted to the front wheels. The gears 54b.sub.2, 54b.sub.4 and 54b.sub.5 engage with the internal teeth 54a.sub.1, 54a.sub.2, 54a.sub.3, respectively so as to lock the viscous coupling 55 and the second planetary gear device 50. Thus, the torque T is transmitted to the rear wheels (T.sub.R =T). The system in the fourth embodiment of the present invention shown in FIGS. 9a to 9c is constructed roughly the same as that of the third embodiment. However, the second change-over coupling device 54 has only three gears 54b.sub.6, 54b.sub.7 and 54b.sub.8. Thus, the selector lever 60 is capable of selecting three position I to III. The positions of the sleeves 53a and 54a for positions I to III shown in FIGS. 9a to 9c correspond to the positions II, III and IV in FIGS. 7b, 7c and 7d respectively. Thus, operation are the same as the system of the third embodiment except for the fact that in the present system, positions where front torque T.sub.F or the rear torque T.sub.R is zero cannot be selected. Although in the afore-described embodiments, the first and second change-over coupling devices are manually controlled, they may be controlled electrically or pneumatically. In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a torque distribution system wherein the distribution ratio of the torque to the front and the rear wheels can be changed in accordance with the driving conditions or at the preference of the driver. Since a viscous coupling is employed, the skidding of wheels can be effectively prevented. While the presently preferred embodiment of the present invention has been shown and described, it is to be understood that this disclosure is for the purpose of illustration and that various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims. * * * * *",

Description BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a system for transmitting the power of an engine to four wheels of a four-wheel drive vehicle and more particularly to an arrangement of a central differential in the system. In a conventional four-wheel drive vehicle having a central differential, which is called a full time four-wheel drive vehicle, the central differential operates to uniformly distribute the torque of an engine to front wheels and to rear wheels of the vehicle. In order to provide a compact transmission system and to decrease the height of the vehicle, the central differential is disposed inside a transmission case. Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 59-81224 discloses such a transmission system for a vehicle having a laterally mounted engine. In the system, a planetary gear device as a central differential is disposed in alignment with an output shaft of the transmission at a side opposed to the engine with respect to the transmission. A sun gear of the planetary gear device is connected to front wheels through a shaft co-axially provided in the output shaft. A carrier is connected to the rear wheels through reduction gears, offset shaft, and so forth. However, in the system of the prior art, since the central differential is disposed at a side of the transmission opposite to the engine and away from the center line with respect to the width of the vehicle, long shafts are necessary for transmitting the power from the central differential to the front and rear transmission systems. Thus, the construction of the transmission system becomes complicated. Furthermore, in some vehicles, overdrive speed gears cannot be easily added to the transmission because the central differential takes up the space for them. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The object of the present invention is to provide a transmission system having a central differential within a transmission case and arranged to simplify the construction thereof and to reduce the space occupied by the system. According to the present invention, there is provided a power transmitting system for a four-wheel drive vehicle having a laterally disposed engine, a transmission, and a central differential device for transmitting power of an engine to front and rear wheels, characterized in that the central differential device is provided at a position between the clutch housing and the transmission. In an aspect of the invention, the central differential is a planetary gear device, a carrier of the planetary gear device is secured to the output shaft of the transmission, and a sun gear and a ring gear of the planetary gear device are arranged as output members, respectively. In another aspect of the invention, the ring gear is secured to the output shaft of the transmission, and sun gear and carrier are arranged as output members, respectively. The other objects and features of this invention will become understood from the following description with reference to the accompanying drawings . BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram of a four-wheel drive power transmission system in a first embodiment of the present invention; and FIGS. 2 to 4 show schematic diagrams showing second to fourth embodiments of the present invention, respectively. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT FIG. 1 shows a power transmission system for a four-wheel drive motor vehicle to which the present invention is applied. An engine 1 is laterally mounted on the motor vehicle at a front portion thereof. The power transmission system comprises a clutch 2 housed in a clutch housing 6, transmission 3 and transfer 5, the latter two housed in a transmission case 7 and an extension case 8. The transmission 3 has an input shaft 10, an output shaft 11 parallel with the input shaft 10, five pairs of change-speed gear 12 to 16 corresponding to first to fifth (overdrive) speed gears, and synchronizers 17 to 19. The synchronizers 17 to 19 are disposed between the gears 12 and 13, between 14 and 15 and adjacent the gears 16, respectively. A reverse drive gear 20 mounted on the input shaft 10 meshes with a gear 21 formed on one side of a sleeve of the synchronizer 17 through an idler gear (not shown) for reverse drive. The transfer device 5 has a planetary gear device 30 and a front differential 4. The planetary gear device 30 is disposed between the transmission 3 and the clutch 2 and serves as a central differential. The planetary gear device 30 comprises a sun gear 31, a ring gear 33 having internal teeth, planet pinions 32 in mesh with both gear 31 and the internal teeth of ring gear 33, and a carrier 34 supporting the pinions 32. The carrier 34 is connected with the output shaft 11. The sun gear 31 is fixedly mounted on a sun gear shaft 35 which is aligned with the output shaft 11 and supported by bearings 36, 37. The ring gear 33 is connected through a tubular shaft 38 to a drive gear 41 rotatably mounted on the sun gear shaft 35. The drive gear 41 meshes with a driven gear 44 integral with a differential case 43 of front differential 4, thereby forming final reduction gear device 40. The front differential 4 is connected to left and right axle shafts 45 of the vehicle so as to transmit the power to front wheels (not shown) of the vehicle. A drive gear 51 of transfer gear device 50 securely mounted on the sun gear shaft 35 meshes with an idler gear 52 rotatably mounted on the differential case 43. The idler gear 52 engages a driven gear 54 securely mounted on a transfer shaft 53 of the transfer device 5. The transfer shaft 53 is connected to a rear drive shaft 56 of the vehicle perpendicular to the transfer shaft 53 through a pair of bevel gears 55, thereby transmitting the power to rear wheels of the vehicle by way of a propeller shaft (not shown). The power of the engine 1 from an output axle thereof is transmitted to the transmission 3 through the clutch 2 and the input shaft 10 and further to the carrier 34 of the planetary gear device 30 through the output shaft 11. The torque is transmitted to the front wheels through ring gear 33, final reduction gear device 40, front differential 4 and axle shafts 45. The torque is transmitted to the rear wheels through ring gear 32, transfer gear device 50, transfer shaft 53 and rear drive shaft 56. The difference between the speed of the front and rear wheels is absorbed as the planet pinions 32 walk around the sun gear 31 and on the ring gear 33. Thus, the planetary gear device 30 operates as a central differential. Accordingly, a full time four-wheel driving mode with the central differential function is established. FIGS. 2 to 4 show other embodiments of the present invention. The same numerals of reference indicate the same parts in the figures. Referring to FIG. 2, the construction of the transmission system is the same as the first embodiment except for some modifications in the transfer device 5. The ring gear 33 of the second embodiment is connected to the drive gear 51 of the transfer gear device 50 instead of to the drive gear 41 of the final reduction gear device 40. On the other hand, the drive gear 41 is fixedly mounted on the sun gear shaft 35. Thus, the torque is transmitted to the front wheels through the sun gear 31 and to the rear wheels through the ring gear 33. In the third and fourth embodiments shown in FIGS. 3 and 4, respectively, the construction of the central differential 30 is modified to connect the output shaft 11 of the transmission 3 to the ring gear 33. As shown in FIG. 3, in the third embodiment, the carrier 34 is connected to the drive gear 41 of the final gears 40 so as to transmit the torque to the front wheels. The sun gear 31 is operatively connected to the transfer gear device 50 in the same manner as the first embodiment of FIG. 1, thereby transmitting the torque to the rear wheels. The carrier 34 in the fourth embodiment, shown in FIG. 4, is operatively connected to the transfer gear device 50. The sun gear 31, in return, is operatively connected to the final reduction gear device 40. The present invention can be applied to a vehicle having engine, clutch and transmission mounted on the rear thereof. From the foregoing, it will be understood that the present invention provides a transmission system having a central differential, disposed between the clutch and the transmission at a center of the vehicle so that power can be transmitted through gears without long shafts. Thus, the construction is greatly simplified, and the overdrive gears can be easily attached to the transmission. Since the central differential is disposed adjacent the final gears and the transfer gear device 50 in parallel to the final reduction gear device 40, lubrication for the central differential can be effected by splashes of oil. While the presently preferred embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described, it is to be understood that this disclosure is for the purpose of illustration and that various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims. * * * * *",

Description BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a system for transmitting the power of an engine to four wheels of a four-wheel drive vehicle. In a conventional four-wheel drive vehicle having a central differential, which is called a full time four-wheel drive vehicle, the central differential operates to uniformly distribute the torque of an engine to the front wheels and to the rear wheels of the vehicle. It is known that the distribution ratio of the torque influences the driveability, steerability, stability, and starting characteristic of the vehicle. Namely, when the distribution to the front wheel is increased, a stable cornering characteristic at high vehicle speed is established, and when distribution to the rear wheels is increased, steerability at low vehicle speed is improved. In the conventional four-wheel drive vehicle, the distribution ratio of the torque for the front wheels to rear wheels can not be changed. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The object of the present invention is to provide a system which may change the distribution ratio of torque to front wheels and rear wheels in accordance with driving conditions of a four-wheel drive vehicle. The other objects and features of this invention will become understood from the following description with reference to the accompanying drawings .

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT FIGS. 1a and 1b show a power transmission system for a four-wheel drive motor vehicle to which the present invention is applied. An engine 1 is longitudinally mounted on the motor vehicle at a front portion thereof, thus forming a transaxle type. The power transmission system housed in a transmission case comprises a clutch 2, transmission 4 and transfer device 18. The transmission 4 has an input shaft 3, a tubular output shaft 5 parallel with the input shaft 3, four pairs of change-speed gears 6 to 9 corresponding to first to fourth speed gears, and synchronizers 10 and 11. The synchronizers 10 and 11 are disposed between the gears 6 and 7 and between the gears 8 and 9, respectively. A reverse drive gear 12 mounted on the input shaft 3 meshes with a gear 13 formed on one side of a sleeve of the synchronizer 10 through an idler gear (not shown) for reverse drive. A front drive shaft 14 is rotatably supported in the output shaft 5 and by a bearing 14a. A drive pinion 15 at the front end of the shaft 14 meshes with a crown gear 17 of a front differential 16 so as to transmit the power to the front wheels. In a transfer device 18 disposed behind the transmission, a rear drive shaft 19 is disposed in parallel with the front drive shaft 14. The rear drive shaft 19 is connected to rear wheels through a propeller shaft 20 and a rear differential 21. The shaft 19 is supported by bearings 19a and 19b. The transfer device 18 has a planetary gear device 30, disposed so as to serve as a central differential. The planetary gear device 30 comprises a sun gear 31, a ring gear 32 having internal teeth, planet pinions 33 in mesh with both gear 31 and the internal teeth of ring gear 32, and a carrier 34 supporting the pinions 33. A first gear 35 is formed on the carrier 34. The carrier 34 is connected with the output shaft 5 and the sun gear 31 is connected to a second gear 23a which is in mesh with a third gear 23 securely mounted on the rear drive shaft 19. The first gear 35 meshes with a fourth gear 24 which is rotatably mounted on the rear drive shaft 19. In order to control the distribution of torque to the front and rear wheels, or to lock the differential mechanism of the planetary gear device, first and second fluid operated multiple-disk friction clutches 40 and 45 are provided on front drive shaft 14 and rear drive shaft 19. The first clutch 40 has inner disks 41 connected to the ring gear 32 of the planetary gear device 30, movable outer disks 41a secured to a drum 42, an oil chamber 40a and a spring 42a. The drum 42 is connected with the front drive shaft 14. The second clutch 45 comprises movable inner disks 46 connected to the gear 24, a drum 47 having outer disks 46a and being secured to the rear drive shaft 19, an oil chamber 45a, and a spring 47a. The system for controlling the torque distribution has a control unit 50, an oil pump 51, and first and second control valves 52 and 53. Control valves 52, 53 are provided to supply oil to the clutches 40 and 45. The control unit 50 selects an appropriate torque distribution ratio according to driving conditions. The output signal of the control unit 50 is supplied to the valves 52 and 53, so as to control the oil pressure in the clutches 40 and 45. When the vehicle is driven in ordinary driving, which is the most common driving condition, the control unit 50 produces signals to close the control valves 52, 53 so as to reduce the oil pressure applied to chambers 40a and 46a. Thus, the first clutch 40 engages and the second clutch 45 disengages by operations of the springs 42a and 46a. Accordingly, the ring gear 32 is coupled to the front drive shaft 14. The power of the engine 1 is transmitted to the transmission 4 through the clutch 2 and the input shaft 3 and further to the carrier 34 of the planetary gear device 30 through the output shaft 5. The torque is transmitted to the front wheels through the pinions 33, ring gear 32, first clutch, front drive shaft 14 and the front differential 16. The torque of the carrier 34 is transmitted to the rear wheels through pinions 33, sun gear 31, gears 23a, 23, rear drive shaft 19, propeller shaft 20 and the rear differential 21. The difference between the speed of the front and rear wheels is absorbed as the plant pinions 33 walk around the sun gear and on the ring gear 32. Thus, the planetary gear device 30 operates as a central differential. Accordingly, a full time four-wheel driving mode with the central differential function is established. Since the torque is transmitted to the rear and front wheels through the sun gear 31 and the ring gear 32, respectively, the torque is distributed in accordance with the difference between the gear ratios of the sun gear 31 and the ring gear 32 (the diameter of the ring gear is larger than the sun gear). Therefore, the torque T.sub.F of the front wheels is larger than the torque T.sub.R of the rear wheels (T.sub.F >T.sub.R) thereby improving steering stability during cornering of the vehicle. When the oil pressure in the first and second clutches 40, 45 is increased, the torque of the first clutch 40 is decreased and the torque of the second clutch 45 is increased. Since the torque is additionally transmitted to the rear drive shaft 19, the rear torque is increased. Consequently, the front torque is reduced. When the vehicle is driven on a rough road, the control unit 50 produces lock signals so as to open the control valve 52 and to close the control valve 53. Thus, the oil pressure is applied to the chamber 47a of clutch 45, thereby engaging both clutches. Accordingly, the torque of the output 5 is transmitted to the front wheels through carrier 34, pinions 33, ring gear 32 and clutch 40, and is directly transmitted to the rear wheels through the gears 35, 24 and clutch 45. A part of the torque transmitted to the rear wheels is transmitted to the front wheels through the gears 23, 23a, sun gear 31, pinions 33, and ring gear 32. Since the diameters of the gears 32, 35 and 24 are substantially equal, the torque T.sub.F substantially equals the torque T.sub.R (T.sub.F .apprxeq.T.sub.R). When the vehicle negotiates a corner at low or middle speed, both control valves are opened, so that the clutch 40 is disengaged. Accordingly, the torque is not transmitted to the front wheels, thereby improving steerability. The conditions of the clutches for the aforementioned torque distributions are shown in the following table. TABLE I ______________________________________ Driving First Second Torque Condition Clutch 40 Clutch 45 Distribution ______________________________________ Ordinary Engage Disengage T.sub.F > T.sub.R Driving Rough Engage Engage T.sub.F .apprxeq. T.sub.R Road Cornering Disengage Engage T.sub.F = O or at low or T.sub.F << T.sub.R middle speed ______________________________________ During ordinary driving which is frequently used, both clutches 40 and 45 are not supplied with oil. Accordingly, loss of energy can be reduced. FIG. 2 shows the second embodiment of the present invention. The contruction of the power transmission system is the same as the first embodiment except for the arrangement of the planetary gear device in the transfer device 18. In the second embodiment, a first gear 35a corresponding to the first gear 35 in the first embodiment is formed on the periphery of the ring gear 32. The diameter of the first gear 35a is the same as the second gear 23a. Other parts of FIG. 2 are the same as FIG. 1 and are identified by the same references. The operation of the system is also the same as the first embodiment. In the third embodiment of FIG. 3, the planetary gear device 30 is the same as the device 30 in FIG. 2. In the device of FIG. 3, the second and third gears 23a and 23 in FIG. 2 are not provided, and the first and second clutches 40, 45 are different from those of FIG. 2 in construction. Namely, the first clutch 40 has movable inner disks 41b, outer disks 41c, oil chamber 40b and spring 42b. The second clutch 45 comprises disks 46b, movable outer disks 46c and oil chamber 45b, and spring 47b. When the vehicle is driven in ordinary driving, the control unit 50 produces signals to close the control valves 52, 53 so as to reduce the oil pressure applied to chambers 40b and 45b. Thus, the first clutch 40 disengages and the second clutch 45 engages. Accordingly, the torque is transmitted to the front wheels through carrier 34, pinions 33, sun gear 31, and front drive shaft 14. The torque is also transmitted to the rear drive shaft 19 through carrier 34, pinions 33, ring gear 32, gears 35a, 24. The difference between the speed of the front and rear wheels is absorbed by the planetary gear device 30 operating as a central differential. The torque is distributed in accordance with the difference between the gear ratios of the sun gear 31 and the ring gear 32. Therefore, the torque T.sub.F of the front wheels is smaller than the torque T.sub.R of the rear wheels (T.sub.F <T.sub.R). When the vehicle is driven on a rough road, the control unit 50 produces lock signals so as to close the control valve 52 and to open the control valve 53. Thus, the oil pressure is applied to the chamber 40b of clutch 40, thereby engaging both clutches. Accordingly, the torque of the output shaft 5 is transmitted to the front wheels through carrier 34, pinions 33, ring gear 32 and clutch 40, and to the rear wheels through gears 35a, 24 and clutch 45. Since the diameters of the gears 32, 35a and 24 are substantially equal, the torque T.sub.F is substantially equal to the torque T.sub.R (T.sub.F .apprxeq.T.sub.R). When the vehicle negotiates a corner at low or middle speed, both control valves 52, 53 are opened, so that the clutch 45 is disengaged. Accordingly, the torque is not transmitted to the rear wheels, thereby improving steerability. The conditions of clutches for the aforementioned torque distributions are shown in the following table.

Other parts of the system are the same as the third embodiment of FIG. 3. Accordingly the same references are used for corresponding parts. The operation of the system of FIG. 4 is also the same as the system of FIG. 3. While the presently preferred embodiment of the present invention has been shown and described, it is to be understood that this disclosure is for the purpose of illustration and that various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims. * * * * *",

Description BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to an overdrive system for a four-wheel drive vehicle having an automatic transmission and a clutch which is manually or automatically engaged to transmit power of an engine to auxiliary driving wheels for establishing a four-wheel driving power transmission. Generally, the four-wheel driving is used when the vehicle is driven on slippery or icy or snowy roads for safety driving, and the overdriving is hardly used during such four-wheel driving. Accordingly, the overdrive system is provided for two-wheel driving, and it is not necessary to provide for four-wheel driving. On the other hand, an overdrive device which is directly coupled to the crankshaft of an engine by a lock-up device of a torque converter is desirable for fuel economy. However, in such a system, a lock-up device and a system for operating the lock-up device must be installed, which causes complicated mechanical construction and complex control system. Japanese patent application laid open No. 57-61843 discloses an overdrive system comprising a pair of speed up gears provided on an oil pump drive shaft inherently installed in the automatic transmission and a clutch for establishing the overdrive. However, it is difficult to employ such an overdrive system in a four-wheel drive vehicle which is provided with a transfer device including a clutch for establishing the four-wheel driving, since the transfer device is positioned at a place for installing the overdrive system. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The object of the present invention is to provide an overdrive system for an automatic transmission which is composed by using a part of a transfer device for auxiliary driving wheels, whereby the system can be simplified in construction. To this end, the present invention is characterized in that the system comprises an automatic transmission having a main transmission system for transmitting output of an automatic transmission device to main driving wheels, an auxiliary transmission system having a transfer drive shaft for transmitting the output to auxiliary driving wheels through an auxiliary drive shaft, an oil pump operatively connected to a crankshaft of an engine by an oil pump drive shaft. The system further comprises an extension of the oil pump drive shaft, a drive gear secured to the transfer drive shaft, a driven gear rotatably mounted on the extension of the oil pump drive shaft and engaged with the drive gear, a first clutch comprising a third engaging member secured to the first engaging member and a fourth engaging member secured to the auxiliary drive shaft for coupling the driven gear with the extension, a second clutch for coupling the driven gear with the auxiliary drive shaft for transmitting the output to auxiliary driving wheels, first means for disengaging a forward clutch in the automatic transmission device for disconnecting automatic transmission device, second means for engaging the first clutch at the same time as the disengagement of the forward clutch, third means for engaging the second clutch and for establishing four-wheel driving, and fourth means for inhibiting the engagement of one of the first and second clutches when the other is engaged. Other objects and features of this invention will be apparently understood from the following description with reference to the accompanying drawing. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING The single FIGURE is a schematic sectional view of an automatic transmission employed with an overdrive system of the present invention. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Referring to the FIGURE, a crankshaft 1 of an internal combustion engine (E) mounted on a front portion of a vehicle (not shown) is operatively connected with a torque converter 2 of an automatic transmission A. The automatic transmission A comprises the torque converter 2, an automatic transmission device 4, and a final reduction device 14 for front wheels of the vehicle. The torque converter 2 comprises a pump impeller 2a and a turbine 2b. The pump impeller 2a is in direct connection with the engine crankshaft 1 through a drive plate 2c. A turbine shaft 3 is extended from the turbine 2b to the automatic transmission device 4. The automatic transmission device 4 comprises a planetary gear 5, forward clutch 6 and reverse clutch 7 for selectively transmitting the output of the turbine shaft 3 to the planetary gear 5, a one-way clutch 8, a brake 9 and brake band 10 for selectively locking elements of the planetary gear 5. The output of the automatic transmission device 4 is transmitted to an output shaft 11 on which a drive gear 12 is securely mounted and which in turn engages with a driven gear 13. The driven gear 13 is securely mounted on a shaft 16, on one end of which a drive pinion 17 is formed. The drive pinion 17 engages with a crown gear 15 of the final reduction device 14 for the front wheels. The other end of the shaft 16 is connected to a transfer drive shaft 18 which extends rearwardly and is operatively connected to a rear drive shaft 20 through a transfer device 19. The rear drive shaft 20 is further operatively connected to a final reduction device 22 for rear wheels of the vehicle through a propeller shaft 21. An oil pump drive shaft 27 is operatively secured to the drive plate 2c, extends passing through the turbine shaft 3 and is connected to an oil pump 26 provided in an end portion of the automatic transmission device 4. The pump drive shaft 27 is connected to an overdrive drive shaft 27a. The transfer device 19 comprises a drive gear 23 secured to the transfer drive shaft 18, a driven gear 24 rotatably mounted on the overdrive drive shaft 27a, an overdrive clutch 28, and a rear-wheel drive clutch 25. Each of the clutches 28 and 25 is a hydraulically operated friction clutch. The clutch 28 comprises an engaging member 28a secured to the driven gear 24 and an engaging member 28b secured to the overdrive drive shaft 27a. The clutch 25 comprises an engaging member 25a secured to the engaging member 28a and an engaging member 25b secured to the rear drive shaft 20. Pressurized oil from the oil pump 26 is supplied to a control valve block 30 through a passage 33 and to a pressure chamber of the rear-wheel drive clutch 25 through a passage 34 and a solenoid operated valve 31. The valve block 30 supplies pressurized oil to the forward clutch 6 through a passage 35, a solenoid operated directional control valve 36 and a passage 37, and to the overdrive clutch 28 through a passage 38. The valve block 30 also supplies pressurized oil to other devices such as the reverse clutch 7 and brake 9. A solenoid 40 for operating the directional control valve 36 is connected to a battery 41 through an overdrive switch 42, D-range switch 43, governor switch 44, inhibitory switch 45 and normally closed switch 46 of a kickdown relay 47. The inhibitory switch 45 is adapted to be operated in dependency on the operation of a four-wheel drive switch 32. A spool 48 of the valve 36 is held at the illustrated position by a spring 50. Pressurized oil from the valve block 30 is supplied to the forward clutch 6 through passage 35, valve ports 51, 52 and passage 37 to engage the clutch 6. Oil in a pressure chamber of the clutch 28 is drained through the passage 38, a port 53, and a passage 54 formed in the spool 48 and a drain port 55. When the solenoid operated valve 31 is closed, the output of the automatic transmission is transmitted to the front wheels through the drive pinion 17 and final reduction device 14, thereby driving the vehicle by the front wheels. For example, in the D-range (driving range) of the automatic transmission, engagement of clutch 6 establishes forward driving condition. Engagement of the one-way clutch 8 provides a 1st speed transmission and applying of the brake band 10 provides a 2nd speed transmission. When clutch 7 is engaged, a 3rd speed is established. When the four-wheel drive switch 32 is manually operated to open the solenoid operated valve 31, oil is supplied to the clutch 25 to engage it. Thus, the output of the automatic transmission is transmitted to the rear wheels through the gears 23 and 24, clutch 25 and shafts 20 and 21, thereby establishing four-wheel driving. In the D-range, the D-range switch 43 is closed. The inhibitory switch 45 is closed if the four-wheel drive switch 32 is not operated, which means the transmission is in two-wheel drive. The governor switch 44 is closed, when vehicle speed exceeds a predetermined value, for example 60 km/h. Accordingly, under conditions of two-wheel driving in D-range at a speed higher than the predetermined speed, when the overdrive switch 42 is closed by manual operation or accelerator pedal operation, solenoid 40 is excited, so that the spool 48 is moved to the right. At the right position of the spool 48, oil in the pressure chamber of the forward clutch 6 is drained through passage 37, port 52, passage 56 formed in the spool 48, and drain port 57. Accordingly, the clutch 6 is disengaged, so that the automatic transmission 4 does not operate. On the other hand, port 51 is communicated with port 53. Thus, pressurized oil is supplied to the pressure chamber of the overdrive clutch 28 to engage it. Thus, rotation of overdrive drive shaft 27a is transmitted to the front wheels through clutch 28, speed up gears 24, 23, shafts 18, 16 and pinion 17. Accordingly, the vehicle is overdriven directly from the crankshaft with speed up gears 24, 23. When a kickdown switch 58 is closed by kickdown operation of the accelerator pedal during the overdrive, the relay 47 is energized to open the switch 46. Thus, solenoid 40 is de-energized to shift the spool to the left, so that the clutch 6 is engaged and clutch 28 is disengaged. Accordingly, the automatic transmission operates to drive the vehicle. If the switch 32 is operated for the four-wheel drive, the inhibitory switch 45 is opened. Accordingly, if the overdrive switch 42 is closed during four-wheel driving, the overdrive clutch 28 is not engaged. The following table shows operations of the clutches and brakes, in which \"C\" and \"B\" designate clutch and brake, and the suffix added to the abbreviation is the numeral used in the FIGURE, and the mark \"O\" means the operation. ______________________________________ Speed B.sub.9 C.sub.8 C.sub.6 B.sub.10 C.sub.7 C.sub.28 C.sub.25 ______________________________________ Front 1 O O Wheel 2 O O Drive 3 O O O.D O 4 WD 1 O O O 2 O O O 3 O O O ______________________________________ As described above, since the overdrive device is provided by using a part of the transfer device for auxiliary driving wheels, the system of the present invention can be simplified in construction. While the presently preferred embodiment of the present invention has been shown and described, it is to be understood that this disclosure is for the purpose of illustration and that various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims. * * * * *",

            "fullText":"  ( 1 of 1 ) United States Patent 4,552,036 Takano ,   et al. November 12, 1985 Automatic transmission for automotive vehicles Abstract An automatic transmission for four-wheel drive automotive vehicles comprising a torque converter, an automatic transmission connected to a turbine shaft of the torque converter for transmitting the output of the engine to the front-wheel, a fluid operated clutch for transmitting the output to the rear-wheel, and a pressure oil control for operating the automatic transmission. The pressure oil control includes a pressure regulator valve to produce a line pressure according to the operational condition of the engine and a changeover valve for operating the clutch.

Description BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to an automatic transmission for an automotive vehicle for driving front and rear wheels, and more particularly to an automatic transmission of the trans-axle type which is adapted to drive either two-wheels or four-wheels. In recent years, the front wheel drive automobile in which the engine is mounted in a front position of the vehicle has been widely used, because of light weight and a safe steering operation. Further, there has been provided a front wheel drive automobile with an automatic transmission, in which the automatic transmission is integrally assembled with the final reduction gear for the front wheel drive. It occasionally is difficult to drive the two-wheel drive vehicle at a low speed under a heavy load in such driving conditions as a rapid starting, rough road driving or steep slope climbing. To eliminate such a defect, there has been provided an automobile having a transmission and a clutch adapted to drive either the front two wheels or both the front and rear four-wheels in which the rear wheels are driven through a clutch means. Since the clutch means is a dog clutch, operation for coupling the clutch must be performed in a stopped state of the vehicle or in a straight forward driving state where no rotational difference between the front and rear wheels exists. In an automatic transmission for the rear-wheel drive a shift lever for the clutch means must be operated after the select lever of the transmission has been shifted to the neutral position (N) or the parking position (P) for cutting off the power. Accordingly, manipulation of the levers is complicated, which means a decrease in the utility of the automatic transmission. Therefore, it is desirable that the front wheel drive is automatically changed to the four-wheel drive in accordance with the driving condition. Further, the four-wheel drive is desirable during rearward driving, on a slope and a rough road. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention has an object to provide an automatic transmission having a pressure-oil-operated multiple-disk clutch for the rear-wheel drive, whereby the change between the front-wheel drive and the four-wheel drive can be performed according to various driving conditions of the automotive vehicle and further the multiple-disk clutch may be automatically operated by the pressure oil used in the automatic transmission in accordance with the driving condition of the vehicle. With the above and other objects and advantages in view, the present invention will become more clearly understood in connection with the detailed description of a preferred embodiment, when considered with the accompanying drawings, of which: DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIGS. 1a and 1b which are broken-away overlapping continuation views together constitute a sectional view of a four-wheel driving automatic transmission according to the present invention; FIG. 2 is a schematic illustration of the transmission of FIGS. 1a, 1b; FIG. 3 is a circuit of the pressure oil control means; and FIG. 4 is a graph showing a relation between speed of a vehicle and line pressure in the circuit of FIG. 3. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Referring to FIGS. 1a, 1b and 2, numeral 1 generally designates an automatic transmission which comprises a torque converter 2, an automatic transmission means 3, a final reduction gear 4 and a pressure oil control means 5 for pressure oil. In accordance with the present invention, a multiple-disk clutch means 6 is attached to the rear portion of the automatic transmission means 3. The torque converter 2 comprises an impeller 2a, a turbine 2b and a stator 2c. The impeller 2a is connected to a crank shaft 8 of an engine through a drive plate 9 and a turbine shaft 10 of the turbine 2b extends to the automatic transmission means 3. As well known, power of the engine is transferred to the turbine shaft 10 according to the load. A cover 11 secured to the drive plate 9 is connected to an oil pump-driving shaft 12 which passes through the turbine shaft 10 and is coupled to an oil pump 13 provided in a rear portion of the automatic transmission means 3. Thus, the oil pump 13 is driven by the engine. The automatic transmission means 3 comprises a planetary gear 15 and a plurality of fluid operated means for producing various operational ranges. The fluid operated means comprises a low and reverse brake 16, a forward-drive clutch 17 and a reverse clutch 18. The turbine shaft 10 is connected to a forward sun gear 15a of the planetary gear 15 by means of the forward clutch 17 and is further connected to a reverse sun gear 15b by means of the reverse clutch 18 and connecting shell 19. By actuating the clutches 17 and 18 with pressure oil, power of the turbine shaft 10 is transmitted to the sun gear 15a or 15b. A brake band 20 is provided on a drum 18a secured to the connecting shell 19 to block the reverse sun gear 15b. In connection with the planetary gear 15, a short pinion 15c and a long pinion 15d are supported by a carrier 15e on which the low and reverse brake 16 is provided. Between the brake 16 and a center support 21, a one-way clutch 22 is provided. The carrier 15e may be locked by operation of the brake 16 and the one-way clutch 22. The ring gear 15f of the planetary gear 15 is connected to an output shaft 23 mounted on the turbine shaft 10. The planetary gear 15 is also provided with a parking gear 24. The output shaft 23 is rotatably supported in a case 25 between a housing 7 of the torque converter 2 and a case 14 of the automatic transmission means 3. The final reduction gear 4 is located between the output shaft 23 and the case 25. The final reduction gear 4 for the front wheel drive comprises a drive pinion 26 and a crown gear 29 of a differential 28. The drive pinion 26 is driven by the output shaft 23 by means of a reduction gear 27. The clutch means 6 comprises a rear drive shaft 31 rotatably supported in a case 30 and a multiple-disck clutch 35 operated by pressure oil. The multiple-disk clutch 35 comprises a drum 35a secured to the rear drive shaft 31 and a hub 35b connected to a transfer gear 34 by a transfer driven gear. The transfer gear 34 is connected to a shaft 33 coupled to the drive pinion 26 by a joint 32. The rear drive shaft 31 is connected to a propeller shaft 37 through a universal joint 36. The control means 5 is provided in a housing 38 secured in an oil pan 39. Referring to FIG. 3, a conduit 40' from an oil pump 13 is connected to a pressure regulator valve 41 to produce a line pressure in a pressure oil circuit. The line pressure is applied to a manual shift valve 42 through a conduit 40 and also is applied to the torque converter 2 and to necessary lubricating portions through conduits 43. The manual valve 42 is adapted to change the operational range of the automatic transmission such as an N-range (neutral), P-range (parking), R-range (reverse), D-range (driving 1, 2, 3), 1-range, 2-range. In the D-range, the line pressure is applied to a governor valve 45, a 1-2 shift valve 46 and the forward-drive clutch 17 through conduits 44 and is applied to a second lock valve 48 and a 2-3 shift valve 49 through conduits 47, and further is applied to the valve 48 through a conduit 50. In the R-range, the line pressure is applied to the 1-2 shift valve 46 through a conduit 51 to inhibit the operation thereof and further is applied to the low and reverse brake 16 through a conduit 52. The line pressure is also applied to the port 41a of the pressure regulator valve 41 and to the 2-3 shift valve 49 through conduits 53. The governor valve 45 is adapted to produce a governor pressure according to the speed of the vehicle. The governor pressure is supplied to shift valves 46 and 49, a 2-3 timing valve 55 and a pressure modifier valve 56 through conduits 54. Further, the line pressure in the conduit 40 is applied to a vacuum throttle valve 57 operated by a vacuum control diaphragm to produce a throttle pressure according to the load of the engine. The throttle pressure is applied to a port 56a of the pressure modifier valve 56, the 2-3 shift valve 49, the 2-3 timing valve 55 and a port 41b of the line pressure-increasing side of the pressure regulator valve 41. Another port 56b of the pressure modifier valve 56 is connected to a port 41c of the line pressure-decreasing side of the pressure regulator valve 41 by a conduit 59. When the governor pressure is low in the D-range, the pressure modifier valve 56 is not operated so that the throttle pressure acts on the port 41b only to increase the line pressure. If the pressure modifier valve 56 is actuated by a higher governor pressure according to an increase of speed of the vehicle, the ports 56a and 56b are communicated with each other so that a throttle pressure is applied to the port 41c of the valve 41 through the conduit 59. The throttle pressure acts on the plunger of the valve 41 against the throttle pressure from the port 41b, so that the line pressure by the valve 41 is decreased. FIG. 4 shows variation of the line pressure in the system. When the throttle valve of the carburetor is fully opened, the line pressure varies as shown by line \"a\". The line \"b\" shows the line pressure in a throttle closed condition. Further, the 1-2 shift valve 46 is connected to an apply side of the servo 20' of the brake band 20 through the second lock valve 48 and conduit 60 to apply the line pressure. The 2-3 shift valve communicates with a release side of the servo 20', the 2-3 timing valve 55, and the reverse clutch 18 through conduits 61 to supply the line pressure. In the above pressure oil circuit for the automatic transmission, a solenoid operated changeover valve 62 is provided to communicate the conduit 40 with the clutch 35. The changeover valve 62 comprises a plunger 62b slidably disposed in a cylinder 62a and urged to the left by a spring 62e. A solenoid 62c is provided to shift the plunger 62b against the spring 62e. An end port 62d opposite the spring is connected to the conduit 44 through a conduit 63 and a normally closed port 62f is connected to the conduit 40 through a conduit 64. The changeover valve 62 further has a port 62g communicating with the clutch 35 through a conduit 65 and a drain port 62h. The solenoid 62c is connected to a battery 67 through a four-wheel drive switch 66 which is operable by the driver. The system further comprises a throttle back up valve 68 for delaying the operation when shifted to the 2-range or 1-range, and a downshift valve 69 actuated by a solenoid 70. In operation, the line pressure regulated by the pressure regulator valve 41 is applied to the manual valve 42 and the torque converter 2 to operate it. In the D-range, the low line pressure is supplied to the forward clutch 17 through the manual valve 42. Thus, the output power of the turbine shaft 10 is transmitted to the forward sun gear 15a. Since the carrier 15e is locked by the one-way clutch 22, the output shaft 23 rotates in the maximum reduction ratio. The rotation of the output shaft 23 is transmitted to the differential 28 by means of the reduction gear 27 and to the clutch means 6 by means of the shaft 33 and gear 34. Since the line pressure is low, the plunger 62b of the changeover valve 62 is held in the left position (FIG. 3) so that the port 62f is closed and the ports 62g and 62h communicate with each other. Thus, the clutch 35 is in the disengaged state and therefore only the front wheels are driven at the first speed. When the governor pressure increases with an increase of the speed of the vehicle, the 1-2 shift valve 46 operates to supply the line pressure in the conduit 44 to the servo 20' of the brake 20 through the second lock valve 48 and the conduit 60 to clamp the brake 20. The reverse sun gear 15b is locked, so that the second-speed drive condition is established. When the governor pressure further increases, the 2-3 shift valve 49 is also actuated to supply the line pressure in the conduit 47 to the release side of the servo 20' and to the reverse clutch 18 through the conduit 61. Thus, the brake 20 is released and the reverse clutch 18 is applied, so that the automatic transmission becomes integrated to couple the turbine shaft 10 with the output shaft 23. The output of the engine is directly transmitted to the output shaft 23 as the third-speed drive condition. In a low speed state of the vehicle in such a condition, since the governor pressure applied to the right side of the pressure modifier valve 56 is low, the plunger is in a right end position to close the port 56b. Therefore, the throttle pressure acts on the pressure regulator valve 41 through the port 41b, so that the line pressure is at a high level. When line pressure exceeds the line pressure shown by the dotted line in FIG. 4, the plunger 62b of the changeover valve 62 is moved to the right against the spring 62e to close the port 62h and to communicate ports 62f and 62g with each other. Thus, the line pressure in the conduit 40 is applied to the clutch 35 to engage the drum 35a with the hub 35b, so that the rear wheels are driven by means of the rear drive shaft 31 and the propeller shaft 37. Thus, the vehicle is driven by the four-wheel drive. When the governor pressure increases as the speed of the vehicle increases, the plunger of the pressure modifier valve 56 is moved to the left to open the port 56b. Thus, the throttle pressure is applied to the port 41c of the pressure regulator valve 41 through the conduit 59 to decrease the line pressure. As a consequence, the changeover valve 62 returns to the normal position to release the clutch, so that the system returns to the front-wheel drive. Further, if the switch 66 is closed in the front wheel drive, the solenoid 62c of the changeover valve 62 is energized to shift the plunger 62b against the spring 62e. Thus, the line pressure is applied to the clutch 35 to establish the four-wheel drive. In the R-range, the line pressure in the conduit 40 is applied to the low and reverse brake 16 through the valve 42, the conduit 51, the 1-2 shift valve 46 and the conduit 52, so that the low and reverse brake 16 is actuated. Further, the line pressure is applied to the reverse clutch 18 and the brake band 20 via the conduit 53, 2-3 shift valve 49 and the conduit 61. Thus, the output of the turbine shaft 10 is transmitted to the reverse sun gear 15b by means of the reverse clutch 18 and the connecting shell 19. Since the carrier 15e is locked by the low and reverse brake 16, the output shaft 23 rotates in reverse at a large reduction ratio. If the switch 66 is closed to operate the changeover valve 62, the clutch 35 is engaged to drive the rear wheels for the four-wheel drive. It will be understood that the line pressure in conduit 53 may be employed for actuating the changeover valve 62, whereby the four-wheel drive may be established in the rearward driving according to the driving condition. Further, the changeover valve 62 may be manually operated by means of a link mechanism from the driver's area. In accordance with the present invention, since a multiple-disk clutch operated by the line pressure in the automatic transmission is provided to transmit the output of the engine of the automotive vehicle to the rear wheels, changing operation from the condition of driving the front wheels to the four-wheel drive condition may be performed in any driving condition. Further, the transmission is automatically or manually changed to the four-wheel drive condition in a heavy load at a low speed of the vehicle, where the front wheels may be prone to slip. Thus, start acceleration ability and driveability may be improved. Since the multiple-disk clutch for driving the rear wheels is adapted to be operated by the line pressure of the automatic transmission, the construction may be simplified and it is easy to convert a front-wheel drive automatic transmission into a four-wheel drive system. * * * * *",

Description BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a four-wheel driving apparatus with an automatic transmission for vehicles, and more particularly to an arrangement of a driving system for front of a vehicle and a driving system for the rear wheels of the vehicle. This kind of driving apparatus is disclosed in Japanese patent application laid-open No. 56-43031. In the disclosed apparatus, the driving system for the front wheels is constructed as a main driving system and driving system for the rear wheels is arranged to be selectively coupled to the main driving system. A final reduction gear device for the front wheels is disposed between a torque converter and an automatic transmission device. An output shaft connected to a planetary gear device is extended forwardly and operatively connected to a pinion shaft for the final reduction gear device through a drive gear and driven gear, thereby driving the front wheels. In order to transmit the output of the automatic transmission to the rear wheels, the pinion shaft is connected to a transfer drive shaft. The transfer drive shaft extends rearwardly passing through a space formed beneath the planetary gear device and brake and clutch devices. The rear end portion of the transfer drive shaft is connected to a rear drive shaft through transfer gears and a clutch for transmitting the output to the rear wheels. Therefore, the pinion shaft must transmit the output to both of the front wheels and the rear wheels, which will overload the shaft on the power transmission. In addition, since the transfer drive shaft must extend between the brake and clutch devices and an oil supply control device, the construction is complicated. Further, the oil supply control device vibrates with the rotation of the transfer drive shaft, causing the oil pressure control to malfunction. Since the transfer drive shaft is in a lower position, the transfer gears are provided to connect the transfer drive shaft with the rear drive shaft which is in a higher position. In addition to the transfer gears, a clutch for driving the rear wheels is positioned adjacent the transfer gears. Therefore, a large space for the transfer gears and clutch must be provided on the rear side of the automatic transmission. The enlarged rear portion of the automatic transmission extends into the passenger's compartment of the vehicle thereby decreasing the capacity of the compartment. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The object of the present invention is to provide a four-wheel driving apparatus with an automatic transmission in which a transfer driving shaft is disposed to extend along the outside of the automatic transmission, whereby the automatic transmission and the device for driving the rear wheels are simple in construction and small in size, and malfunction of the oil pressure control due to the vibration of the transfer drive shaft may be prevented. According to the present invention, there is provided a four-wheel driving apparatus with an automatic transmission for a vehicle having a torque converter connected to an engine mounted on the vehicle, and a turbine shaft of the torque converter for connecting a turbine of the torque converter with the automatic transmission, comprising an output shaft of the automatic transmission, the output shaft being forwardly extended, a driving gear secured to the output shaft, a driving pinion shaft operatively connected to the driving gear, a pinion formed on one end of the driving pinion shaft, a final reduction device operatively connected to the pinion for driving front wheels of the vehicle, a rear drive shaft rotatably supported and rearwardly extended along the outside of the automatic transmission, a driven gear rotatably mounted on the rear drive shaft and operatively connected to the driving gear, and a clutch device mounted on the rear drive shaft and adapted to connect the driven gear with said rear drive shaft for driving the rear wheels of the vehicle. Other objects and features of the present invention will be fully described with reference to the accompanying drawings.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, reference numeral 1 designates a torque converter. An automatic transmission 2 is arranged adjacent to the torque converter 1, a final reduction device 3 for front wheels of a vehicle (not shown) is disposed between the torque converter 1 and the automatic transmission 2, and a driving output transmitting device 4 for rear wheels (not shown) of the vehicle is disposed adjacent to one lateral side of the automatic transmission 2. The torque converter 1 provided in a housing 5 comprises an impeller connected to a crankshaft 6 of an engine mounted on the vehicle (not shown) and a turbine connected to a turbine shaft 7 to transmit the power of the engine thereto. The automatic transmission 2 provided in a transmission case 8 comprises a planetary gear 9, a low and reverse brake 10, a one-way clutch 11, a forward clutch 12 and a reverse clutch 14 with a brake band 13, which are arranged in a well known manner. A cylindrical output shaft 15 of the planetary gear 9 is disposed coaxially with the turbine shaft 7 and forwardly extended towards the torque converter 1. A pressure oil supply control device 17 for supplying the pressure oil to the brake 10, clutches 11 and 12 and other members is disposed between the automatic transmission mechanism and an oil pan 16. An oil pump 20 is provided between a rear cover 18 and a carrier 19. This automatic transmission has a conventional operation. For example, when D-range is selected, the forward clutch 12 is engaged by pressure oil, the output of the turbine shaft 7 is transmitted to the planetary gear 9 and the vehicle is driven at an automatically changed transmission gear ratio. The final reduction device 3 is provided in a case 21 secured to the converter housing 5 and to the transmission case 8. The reduction device 3 comprises a crown gear 22 which is secured to a differential for the front wheels and is engaged with a driving pinion 23a. A driving pinion shaft 23 is positioned immediately below the output shaft 15. A driving gear 24 is securely mounted on the output shaft 15 and a driven gear 25 engaged with the driving gear 24 is secured to the driving pinion shaft 23. Thus, the output of the automatic transmission is transmitted to the final reduction device 3 through the gears 24, 25 and pinion 23a. The driving output transmitting device 4 for the rear wheels comprises an intermediate gear 26 meshed with the driving gear 24, and a driven gear 27 meshed with the intermediate gear 26. The intermediate gear 26 and the driven gear 27 are provided in the case 21 of the final reduction device 3. The gear 27 is positioned in a horizontal plane passing through the output shaft 15 as shown in FIG. 2. The gear 27 is rotatably mounted on a rear drive shaft 28 and is adapted to be connected to the rear drive shaft 28 through a clutch 29. The clutch 29 comprises a synchromesh mechanism 35 secured to the rear drive shaft 28. A sleeve 34 of the synchromesh mechanism 35 is shifted by a shifter 33 secured to a rod 32 of a four-wheel drive selecting device 31, so that the sleeve 34 may be engaged with teeth provided on one side of the gear 27, thereby connecting the gear 27 to the shaft 28. The rear drive shaft 28 extends in the rearward direction in an extension housing 30 and is connected through a propeller shaft (not shown) to a rear differential (also not shown) in a well known manner to drive the rear wheels. In operation, the output transmitted to the automatic transmission through the torque converter 1 diverges the driving gear 24 into the front wheel driving system and the rear wheels driving system. The front wheel driving system transmits the output to the final reduction device 3 through the gear 25, pinion 23a and the crown gear 22. The rear wheel driving system transmits the output to the driven gear 27 through the intermediate gear 26. When the clutch 29 is disengaged, the output is not transmitted to the rear wheels and only the front-wheel driving is performed. When the sleeve 34 is shifted by the shifter 33 to be engaged with the teeth of the gear 27, the output is transmitted to the front wheel driving system as well as to the rear drive shaft 28 through the clutch clutch 29 and further transmitted to the rear wheels. Thus, the vehicle is driven by four wheels. Referring to FIGS. 3 to 5, in this embodiment, the synchromesh mechanism 29 is securely mounted on the rear drive shaft 28 at the front side of the driven gear 27, and the synchromesh mechanism 29 and the gear 27 are covered by the case 21 of the final reduction device 3. The intermediate gear 26 is not shown in FIG. 3 but is shown in FIGS. 4 and 5. Moreover, a cylindrical cover 8' is formed extending from the transmission case 8 and the rear drive shaft 28 extends in the cylindrical cover 8'. An extension housing 38 is connected with the cylindrical case 8 so that the rear of the shaft 28 passes therethrough. Other parts are the same as in the previous embodiment and identified by the same numerals. Referring to FIGS. 6 to 8, a driven gear 27a (not shown in FIG. 6 but shown in FIG. 7) corresponding to the driven gear 27 in the device of FIGS. 1 and 2 is secured to an intermediate shaft 28a, and the axes of the driven gear 27a and the shaft 28a are positioned in substantially a vertical plane including the axis of the output shaft 15 as shown in FIG. 7. The intermediate shaft 28a extends rearwardly is rotatably supported by a bearing provided in a housing 18' which extends from the transmission cover 18. An extension housing 40 is secured to the housing 18', in which a rear drive shaft 41 is substantially disposed in alignment with the turbine shaft 7 and is rotatably supported. A sprocket 42 is secured to the intermediate shaft 28a and a sprocket 43 is rotatably mounted on the rear drive shaft 41 and both sprockets are operatively connected by a chain 44. A synchromesh mechanism 45 is mounted on the rear drive shaft 41 so as to connect the sprocket 43 to the shaft 41 in the same manner as the device of 29, 32-35 FIG. 1. Other parts are the same as in the previous embodiments and identified by the same numerals. In this system, the output of the automatic transmission is transmitted from the output driving gear 24 to the rear drive shaft 41 through the intermediate gear 26a, the driven gear 27a, the intermediate shaft 28a, the sprocket 42, the chain 44, the sprocket 43, and the synchromesh mechanism 45. In all illustrative embodiments the axis of the rear drive shaft is disposed substantially in a horizontal plane including the axis of the output shaft 15. In accordance with the present invention, the output of the automatic transmission diverges at the driving gear 24 fixed on the output shaft 15 into the front wheel driving system and the rear wheel driving system. Therefore, both driving systems are not influenced by each other, thereby offering a stable output transmission.

Description BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to an automatic transmission for an automotive vehicle for driving front and rear wheels, and more particularly to an automatic transmission of the trans-axle type which is adapted to drive either two-wheels or four-wheels. In recent years, the front wheel drive automobile in which the engine is mounted in a front position of the vehicle has been widely used, because of light weight and safe steering operation. Further, there has been provided a front wheel drive automobile with an automatic transmission, in which the automatic transmission is integrally assembled with the final reduction gear for the front wheel drive. By the way, it occasionally is difficult to drive the two-wheel drive vehicle at a low speed under a heavy load in such driving conditions as a rapid starting, rough road driving or steep slope climbing. To eliminate such a defect an automobile having an automatic transmission and a clutch to drive either the front two-wheels or both of the front and rear four-wheels has been provided. Since the clutch means is a dog clutch, operation for coupling the clutch must be performed in a stopped state of the vehicle or in a straightforward driving state where no rotational difference between the front and rear wheels exists. In an automatic transmission for the rear-wheel drive, a shift lever for the clutch means must be operated after the select lever of the transmission has been shifted to the neutral position (N) or the parking position (P) for cutting off the power. Accordingly, manipulation of the levers is complicated, which means a decrease in the utility of the automatic transmission. Therefore, it is desirable that the front wheel drive is changed to the four-wheel drive in accordance with the driving condition. Further, the four-wheel drive is desirable during reverse, on an incline and on a rough road. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention has an object to provide an automatic transmission having a pressure-oil-operated multiple-disk clutch for the rear-wheel drive, whereby the change between the front-wheel drive and the four-wheel drive can be performed according to various driving conditions of the automotive vehicle and further the multiple-disk clutch may be operated by the pressure oil used in the automatic transmission in accordance with the driving condition of the vehicle. With the above and other objects and advantages in view, the present invention will become more clearly understood in connection with the detailed description of preferred embodiments, when considered with the accompanying drawings, of which: DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIGS. 1a and 1b which are broken-away overlapping continuation views together constitute a sectional view of a four-wheel driving automatic transmission according to the present invention; FIG. 2 is a schematic illustration of the transmission of FIGS. 1a, 1b; and FIG. 3 is a circuit of the pressure oil control means. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Referring to FIGS. 1a, 1b and 2, numeral 1 generally designates an automatic transmission which comprises a torque converter 2, an automatic transmission means 3, a final reduction gear 4 and a pressure oil control means 5 for pressure oil. In accordance with the present invention, a multiple-disk clutch means 6 is attached to the rear portion of the automatic transmission means 3. The torque converter 2 comprises an impeller 2a, a turbine 2b and a stator 2c. The impeller 2a is connected to a crank shaft 8 of an engine through a drive plate 9 and a turbine shaft 10 of the turbine 2b extends to the automatic transmission means 3. As well known, power of the engine is transferred to the turbine shaft 10 according to the load. A cover 11 secured to the drive plate 9 is connected to an oil pump-driving shaft 12 which passes through the turbine shaft 10 and is coupled to an oil pump 13 provided in a rear portion of the automatic transmission means 3. Thus, the oil pump 13 is driven by the engine. The automatic transmission means 3 comprises a planetary gear 15 and a plurality of fluid operated means for producing various operational ranges. The fluid operated means comprises a low and reverse brake 16, a forward clutch 17 and a reverse clutch 18. The turbine shaft 10 is connected to a forward sun gear 15a of the planetary gear 15 by means of the forward clutch 17 and is further connected to a reverse sun gear 15b by means of the reverse clutch 18 and connecting shell 19. By actuating the clutches 17 and 18 with pressure oil, power of the turbine shaft 10 is transmitted to the sun gear 15a or 15b. A brake band 20 is provided on a drum 18a secured to the connecting shell 19 to block the reverse sun gear 15b. In connection with the planetary gear 15, a short pinion 15c and a long pinion 15d are supported by a carrier 15e on which the low and reverse brake 16 is provided. Between the brake 16 and a center support 21, a one-way clutch 22 is provided. The carrier 15e may be locked by operation of the brake 16 and the one-way clutch 22. The ring gear 15f of the planetary gear 15 is connected to an output shaft 23 mounted on the turbine shaft 10. The planetary gear 15 is also provided with a parking gear 24. The output shaft 23 is rotatably supported in a case 25 between a housing 7 of the torque converter 2 and a case 14 of the automatic transmission means 3. The final reduction gear 4 is located between the output shaft 23 and the case 25. The final reduction gear 4 for the front wheel drive comprises a drive pinion 26 and a crown gear 29 of a differential 28. The drive pinion 26 is driven by the output shaft 23 by means of a reduction gear 27. The clutch means 6 comprises a rear drive shaft 31 rotatably supported in a case 30 and a multiple-disk clutch 35 operated by pressure oil. The multiple-disk clutch 35 comprises a drum 35a secured to the rear drive shaft 31 and a hub 35b connected to a transfer gear 34 by a transfer driven gear. The transfer gear 34 is connected to a shaft 33 coupled to the drive pinion 26 by a joint 32. The rear drive shaft 31 is connected to a propeller shaft 37 through a universal joint 36. The control means 5 is provided in a housing 38 secured in an oil pan 39. Referring to FIG. 3, a conduit 40' from an oil pump 13 is connected to a pressure regulator valve 41 to produce a line pressure in a pressure oil circuit. The line pressure is applied to a manual shift valve 42 through a conduit 40 and also applied to the torque converter 2 and to necessary lubricating portions through conduits 43. The manual valve 42 is adapted to change the operational range of the automatic transmission such as the N-range (neutral), P-range (parking), R-range (reverse), D-range (driving 1, 2, 3), 1-range, 2-range. For example, in the D-range, the line pressure is applied to a governor valve 45, a 1-2 shift valve 46 and the forward clutch 17 through conduits 44 and is applied to a second lock valve 48 and a 2-3 shift valve 49 through conduits 47, and further is applied to the valve 48 through a conduit 50. In the R-range, the line pressure is applied to the 1-2 shift valve 46 through a conduit 51 to inhibit the operation thereof and further is applied to the low and reverse brake 16 through a conduit 52. The line pressure is also applied to the port 41a of the pressure regulator valve 41 and to the 2-3 shift valve 49 through conduits 53. The governor valve 45 is adapted to produce a governor pressure according to the speed of the vehicle. The governor pressure is supplied to shift valves 46 and 49, a 2-3 timing valve 55 and a pressure modifier valve 56 through conduits 54. Further, the line pressure in the conduit 40 is applied to a vacuum throttle valve 57 operated by a vacuum control diaphragm to produce a throttle pressure according to the load of the engine. The throttle pressure is applied to a port 56a of the pressure modifier valve 56, the 2-3 shift valve 49, the 2-3 timing valve 55 and a port 41b of the line pressure-increasing side of the pressure regulator valve 41. Another port 56b of the pressure modifier valve 56 is connected to a port 41c of the line pressure-decreasing side of the pressure regulator valve 41 by a conduit 59. Further, 1-2 shift valve 46 is connected to an apply side of the servo 20' of the brake band 20 through the second lock valve 48 and conduit 60 to apply the line pressure. The 2-3 shift valve 49 communicates with a release side of the servo, the 2-3 timing valve 55, and the reverse clutch 18 through conduits 61 to supply the line pressure. In the above pressure oil circuit for the automatic transmission, a solenoid operated changeover valve 62 is provided to communicate the conduit 40 with the clutch 35. The changeover valve 62 comprises a plunger 62b slidably disposed in a cylinder 62a and urged to the left by a spring 62d. A solenoid 62c is provided to shift the plunger 62b against the spring 62d. A normally closed port 62e is connected to the conduit 40 through a conduit 63. The changeover valve 62 further has a port 62f communicating with the clutch 35 through a conduit 64 and a drain port 62g. The solenoid 62c is connected to a battery 66 through a four-wheel drive switch 65 which is operable by the driver in the driver's area. The system further comprises a throttle back up valve 67 for delaying the operation when shifted to the 2-range or 1-range, and a downshift valve 68 actuated by a solenoid 69. In operation, the line pressure regulated by the pressure regulator valve 41 is applied to the manual valve 42 and the torque converter 2 to operate it. In the D-range, the low line pressure is supplied to the forward clutch 17 through the manual valve 42. Thus, the output power of the turbine shaft 10 is transmitted to the forward sun gear 15a. Since the carrier 15e is locked by the one-way clutch 22, the output shaft 23 rotates in the maximum reduction ratio. The rotation of the output shaft 23 is transmitted to the differential 28 by means of the reduction gear 27 and to the clutch means 6 by means of the shaft 33 and the transfer gear 34. When the manual switch 65 is opened to de-energize the solenoid 62c, the plunger 62b of the changeover valve 62 is held in the left position (FIG. 3) by the spring 62d so that the port 62e is closed and the ports 62g and 62f communicate with each other. Thus, the clutch 35 is in the disengaged state and hence the only front wheels are driven at the first-speed. When the governor pressure increases with an increase of the speed of the vehicle, the 1-2 shift valve 46 operates to supply the line pressure in the conduit 44 to the servo 20' of the brake band 20 through the second lock valve 48 and the conduit 60 to clamp the brake 20. The reverse sun gear 15b is locked, so that the second-speed drive condition is established. When the governor pressure further increases, the 2-3 shift valve 49 is also actuated to supply the line pressure in the conduit 47 to the release side of the servo and to the reverse clutch 18 through the conduit 61. Thus, the brake 20 is released and the reverse clutch 18 is applied, so that the automatic transmission becomes integrated to couple the turbine shaft 10 with the output shaft 23. The output of the engine is directly transmitted to the output shaft 23 as the third-speed drive condition. When the switch 65 is closed to energize the solenoid 62c, the plunger 62b of the changeover valve 62 is moved to the right against the spring 62d to close the port 62g and to communicate ports 62f and 62e with each other. Thus, the line pressure in the conduit 40 is applied to the clutch 35 to engage the drum 35a with the hub 35b, so that the rear wheels are driven by means of the rear drive shaft 31 and the propeller shaft 37. Thus, the vehicle is driven by the four-wheel drive. In the R-range, the line pressure in the conduit 40 is applied to the low and reverse brake 16 through the valve 42, the conduit 51, the 1-2 shift valve 46 and the conduit 52, so that the low and reverse brake 16 is actuated. Further, the line pressure is applied to the reverse clutch 18 and the brake band 20 via the conduit 53, the 2-3 shift valve 49 and the conduit 61. Thus, the output of the turbine shaft 10 is transmitted to the reverse sun gear 15b by means of the reverse clutch 18 and the connecting shell 19. Since the carrier 15e is locked by the low and reverse brake 16, the output shaft 23 rotates in reverse at a large reduction ratio. If the switch 65 is closed to operate the changeover valve 62, the clutch 35 is engaged to drive the rear wheels for the four-wheel drive. In accordance with the present invention, the transmission may be manually changed to the four-wheel drive condition in any driving condition where the front wheels may be prone to slip. Thus, accelerating ability and driveability may be improved. Since the multiple-disk clutch for driving the rear wheels are adapted to be operated by the line pressure of the automatic transmission, the construction may be simplified and it is easy to convert a front-wheel drive automatic transmission into a four-wheel drive system. * * * * *",

Description BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a transmission apparatus for a four-wheel drive motor vehicle or for conversion to a two-wheel drive vehicle to a four-wheel drive vehicle in general. Particularly it relates to this in a vehicle in which the engine is transversely disposed in the front or rear part of the vehicle and the output of the engine is selectively transmitted to the front and rear wheel axles of the vehicle through the transmission. In such a transverse arrangement of the engine, the transmission and the clutch, the longitudinal distance of the power in the vehicle can be remarkably shortened. A four-wheel drive vehicle based on such an arrangement has already been basically provided. In a four-wheel drive arrangement, engine power is also transmitted from the final reduction device through a transfer device to the wheels other than the main driving wheels. Such an arrangement has the advantage in that the four-wheel drive may be established without any alteration of the disposition in the transmission system. However, because the transfer device which is connected to the final reduction device has to be provided with a clutch device for changing from the two-wheel drive condition to the four-wheel drive condition as well as with shafts and gears for the clutch device, the system occupies a large space using some of the car room. Also it is necessary to provide a gear train to compensate for the speed reduction caused by the final reduction device, which is subject to a large load for four-wheel driving. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide an apparatus in which power for driving the front wheels and the rear wheels is transmitted from different portions in the apparatus, so that only a part of the apparatus is not subject to a load. According to the present invention, there is provided a transmission apparatus for a motor vehicle having an internal combustion engine transversely disposed in the vehicle at an end portion thereof, comprising a transmission transversely disposed and connected to the crankshaft of the engine at one end portion of said transmission, an output gear mounted on an output shaft of the transmission at a position thereof adjacent to an end of the engine, a final reduction gear engaged with the output gear of the transmission, a differential secured to a side of the final reduction gear, an axle connected to the differential, a transfer device provided at another end portion of the transmission, the transfer device comprising a gear train provided at the end portion of the transmission opposite to the end having the output gear and a clutch device for engaging the gear train with an output shaft of the transmission, and a propeller shaft connected to the transfer device for driving other axles for the four-wheel drive. Other objects and features of the present invention will be fully described with reference to the accompanying drawings. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The only FIGURE is a schematic view showing an embodiment of the present invention. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT In the FIGURE, an engine 1 is transversely disposed in a front part of a vehicle. A transmission 4 at one end thereof by its input shaft 7 is disposed in alignment and selective connection with an engine crankskaft 2 through a clutch 3. Thus, the engine 1, the clutch 3 and the transmission 4 are disposed in a transverse arrangement. Near the engine, a final reduction device 5 is positioned transmittingly connected with the end portion of the transmission 4 in common with the end of the transmission 4 which is connected to the crankshaft 2 of the engine 1. At the other end of the transmission 4, a transfer device 6 is disposed in releasable transmitting connection thereto through a transfer shaft 24 which is parallel to an output shaft 8 of the transmission. The transmission is of a synchronized engaging type and, for example, of 4 speeds. The transmission comprises transmission gear trains 9, 10, 11 and 12 rotatably mounted on the transmission shafts 7 and 8 for providing 1st to 4th gears. When one of gears on the shaft 8 is selectively jointly rotatably connected with the shaft 8 by operating a synchromesh mechanism 13 or 14, the power transmitted by one of 1st to 4th gears is produced on the output shaft 8. The final reduction device 5 comprises an output gear 15 which is jointly rotatably connected with the output shaft 8 at the engine side end thereof, and a final reduction gear 16 which is jointly connected with a case 18 of a differential 17 on the engine side thereof. The differential 17 comprises a pair of pinions 20 mounted on a spider 19 and a pair of side gears 21 engaged with the pinions 20. A pair of axles 22 of front wheels of the vehicle extend from the side gears 21 for driving the front wheels. In a transmission case 23 of the transmission 4 constituting the transfer device 6, the transfer shaft 24 is provided parallel to the output shaft 8. A transfer gear 25a is rotatably mounted on an end portion of the output shaft 8, which is opposite to the end where the final reduction device 5 is located. A clutch device 26 such as a friction clutch is provided on the end of the output shaft 8 for engaging the transfer gear 25a with the shaft 8. A transfer gear 25 engages with the transfer gear 25a, the transfer gear 25 being jointly rotatably connected with the transfer shaft 24. A bevel gear 29a is also jointly rotatably connected with the transfer shaft 24. A rear drive shaft 28 is rotatably connected to the transfer shaft 24 by a bevel gear 29 which is jointly rotatably connected with the shaft 28 and engages with the bevel gear 29a. The rear drive shaft is disposed extending through an extension housing 31 which is provided behind the transmission case 23 and is connected to the rear wheels of the vehicle through a propeller shaft 30. In accordance with the apparatus of the present invention output power from the engine is transmitted to the main shaft 7 of the transmission 4 through the clutch 3 which is in engagement with the crankshaft 2, and further to the output shaft 8 through one of gear trains 9 to 12. In the condition with the clutch device 26 disengaged, the power on the output shaft 8 of the transmission 4 is transmitted only to the front wheels through the final reduction device 5, the differential 17, and the axle 22 to achieve front wheel driving. On the other hand, when the clutch device 26 is engaged with the output shaft 8, the output shaft 8 is connected to the transfer shaft 24 through transfer gears 25a and 25. Thus, the power is also transmitted from the output shaft 8 to the transfer shaft 24 through the clutch device 26, gears 25a and 25, and further to the rear wheels through the rear drive shaft 28, the propeller shaft 30, and a rear differential (not shown). Therefore, the power of the engine is transmitted to both the front and rear wheels to establish four-wheel driving. Although, in the above described embodiment, the engine 1 is mounted in a front part of vehicle to drive the front wheels through the final reduction device 5 and to transmit power to the rear wheels through the propeller shaft 30, it is, to the contrary, possible to mount the engine in a rear part of the vehicle to drive the rear wheels through the final reduction device 5 and to transmit the power to the front wheels through the propeller shaft 30. Thus, in accordance with the present invention, an engine and a transmission connected to the engine are transversely mounted on the vehicle, and the transmission has at one end portion thereof a final reduction device and at the other end portion thereof a transfer device, so that the conversion of a conventional car to four-wheel driving car may be easily done by providing a transfer device 6 having a clutch device 26 without any changes in the transmission 4 and the final reduction device 5. Further, because the power is transmitted to all four wheels from separate portions of the transmission, the load for the four-wheel driving is not concentrated on only one part. Thus, a uniform distribution of the load may be effected in the transmission. * * * * *",

Transmission apparatus in a motor vehicle having a frong axle and a rear axle, comprising an engine, a first clutch housing, said clutch device is disposed in said clutch housing, a main transmission housing, a 2-speed sub-transmission operatively connected to said clutch device, and a main transmission operatively connected to said sub-transmission and disposed in said main transmission housing, a final reduction gear connected to the front axle and to said main transmission, a final reduction gear housing, said sub-transmission and said final reduction gear directly therebelow with the front axle are disposed in said final reduction gear housing, a second clutch housing, clutch means for providing four wheel drive for selectively connecting said rear axle with said main transmission, said clutch means being disposed in said second clutch housing, the engine and said first clutch housing, said final reduction gear housing, said main transmission housing and said second clutch housing are disposed substantially horizontally one behind the other. Description BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a transmission apparatus for motor vehicle in which the engine is longitudinally mounted in the front position of the vehicle and output of the engine is transmitted to the front and selectively to the rear axle of the vehicle through the transmission. More particularly the present invention relates to a transmission apparatus which transmits the power of the engine both to the front axle and to four wheels of front and rear. In recent years, the four-wheel driving passenger car has been preferably and widely used, because it has high steering stability. It is desirable that such a car can be economically driven at a high speed on the highway for example with a boat-trailer, camping trailer and the like, and on the other hand, can be powerfully driven on mountain path, on the sands, and the like. Typical means for meeting such a requirement is to increase the changing speed stage of the transmission in number of the stage. However, this means results in complexity of manipulation for changing the speed of the transmission, thereby to decrease its practicability. In order to remove such disadvantages, it has been proposed to provide a sub-transmission together with the main transmission of which sub-transmission may be manipulated to change the transmission speed independent of the main transmission. If there is provided with a main transmission having four-speed-stage and a sub-transmission having two-speed-stage, the transmission having eight-speed-stage may be obtained. Namely, when the sub-transmission is set in the lower speed stage, the main transmission can transmit four speeds in the lower speed range, and when the sub-transmission is set in the higher speed stage, four speed in the higher speed range can be transmitted through the main transmission. In accordance with this sub-transmission apparatus, the manipulation is simply performed, because the main transmission may be manipulated in four stages. However, it is necessary to provide a special space in the transmission housing for the sub-transmission, which results in increase of the transmission in dimensions. Especially, since the above-mentioned transmission apparatus which can be manipulated to convert into four-wheel driving transmission is provided with clutch means for transmitting the power of the engine to the sub-drive wheels, the apparatus inherently has a long length. Therefore, such an apparatus is further increased in length by the sub-transmission. In such a vehicle in which the engine is longitudinally mounted in the front position thereof, the engine must be extended forward from the front wheels more than conventional car because of the long size transmission or the transmission must be positioned rearward whereby the space for the driver in the vehicle is reduced. If the length from the front wheels to the front end of the car becomes long, it will become difficult to manipulate the steering wheel of the car. Further, in the case that the sub-transmission is provided to transmit the output of the main transmission, the sub-transmission must be designed to have great dimensional size. If the inertia lock type synchromesh mechanism is employed in such a sub-transmission, inertia mass of the synchronized members in the mechanism will be great value, which makes the manipulation of the sub-transmission heavy. Therefore, it is the object of the present invention to provide a transmission apparatus which need not a special space for the sub-transmission in the transmission housing, which may be manufactured in small size, and of which sub-transmission may be easily manipulated. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In accordance with the present invention, the engine is positioned in front side of the front axle, a sub-transmission is provided in the space formed above the front axle, a main transmission is adapted to transmit the output of the sub-transmission to the front wheels and to the rear wheels through means for transmitting the output, and the means for transmitting the output includes a clutch means for selectively connecting the transmission to the rear axle.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Referring to the drawings, numeral 1 designates a flywheel secured to the end of crankshaft of the engine which is longitudinally disposed in the front portion of car. A first main drive shaft 3 in alignment with the crankshaft is rotatably supported and a clutch device 2 is provided on the first main drive shaft to engage with the flywheel 1. A 2-speed sub-transmission S is positioned above the front axle F and provided to transmit the power of the engine to a second main drive shaft 10. The sub-transmission S comprises a gear 5 formed on the first main drive shaft 3, counter gears 7 and 8 rotatably mounted on a counter shaft 6, a gear 11 rotatably mounted on the second main drive shaft 10, and an inertia lock type synchromesh mechanism 12 mounted on the second main drive shaft 10 with the spline. The gears 5 and 11 mesh with the gears 7 and 8 respectively. The second main drive shaft 10 is in alignment with the first main drive shaft 3 and extended into a transmission case 13 of a 4-speed main transmission M and rotatably supported by bearings 14 and 15. The main transmission M comprises a lower 2-speed transmission device and a higher 2-speed transmission device. The lower 2-speed transmission device comprises gears 16 and 17 formed on the second main drive shaft 10, gears 18 and 19 rotatably mounted on a third main drive shaft 21 and engaged with the gears 16 and 17 respectively, and a lower speed stage synchromesh mechanism 20 splined on the shaft 21 between the gears 18 and 19. The higher 2-speed transmission device comprises gears 22 and 23 rotatably mounted on the second main drive shaft 10, a higher speed stage synchromesh mechanism 24 splined on the shaft 10 between the gears 22 and 23, gears 25 and 26 keyed on the third main drive shaft 21 and engaged with the gears 22 and 23 respectively. It should be noted that the back gear mechanism is not shown in the drawings. The third main drive shaft 21 is rotatably supported by bearings 27 and 28 and provided with a hypoid pinion 30 formed at the front end thereof. The hypoid pinion 30 meshes with a ring gear 31 of a final reduction gear device mechanism. The final reduction gear device is positioned beneath the sub-transmission S in the space between the clutch device 2 and the main transmission M, and adapted to transmit the output of the third main drive shaft 21 to the front wheel through the front axle F. The rear end of the third main drive shaft 21 extends out of the transmission case 13, on which a gear 37 is fixed with a spline engagement. On the rear end of the transmission case 13 is provided a housing 33 in which a rear wheel drive shaft 34 is rotatably supported by bearings 35 and 36. On the rear wheel drive shaft 34 is rotatably mounted a gear 38 which engages the gear 37. A rear wheel drive synchromesh mechanism 40 is mounted on the rear wheel drive shaft with spline. The rear wheel drive shaft 34 is connected to a rear axle through a propeller shaft (not shown). Device for manipulating the clutch means in the sub-transmission S and for coupling the third main drive shaft 21 to the rear wheel drive shaft 34 will be described hereinafter. A shift fork 43 is rotatably supported by a shaft 44, and opposite ends of the fork are slidably engaged with a circumferential groove 42 of a sleeve 41 which is a part of the synchromesh mechanism 12 as well known mechanism. The lever of the shift fork 43 is pivotally connected to a link 45 of which rear end is connected to a shift rod 46 through a connecting member 47. The shift rod 46 is slidably supported in the housing 33, and provided with a pair of notches 48 and 49 as shown in FIG. 5. With one of the notches, a lock ball 50 is engaged by means of a spring 51 so that the shift rod 46 may be locked at the notches 48 or 49. On the shift rod 46, an arm 52 is fixedly provided by means of a pin 53 and a shift fork 54 is slidably mounted at base portion 54a thereof. The shift fork 54 engages a circumferential groove 59 of a sleeve 58 of the synchromesh mechanism 40 so as to shift the sleeve along the shaft 34. The base portion 54a is provided with a pair of notches 55 and 56 and a spring loaded lock ball 57 engages with one of the notches to lock the shift fork at the notch 55 or 56. An actuating rod 60 is slidably supported in the housing 33 at a position adjacent and parallel to the shift rod 46, the arm 52 and shift fork 54 being slidably mounted thereon. The actuating rod 60 is provided with a snap ring 61 (FIG. 6) and notches 62 and 63. On the guide plate 64 secured to the housing 33, a pair of notches 65 and 66 are provided opposite the notches 62 and 63. In the arm 52 and the fork 54 are provided holes 67 and 68 which correspond to the notches 62 and 63 respectively. The holes 67 and 68 receive slidable pins 70 and 71 each of which has a length sufficient to engage corresponding one notch. On the rear end of the actuating rod 60 is connected a shift lever 72 which is pivoted by a pin 73 on the bracket 75 secured to the housing 33. FIG. 6a shows front wheel driving position of the shifting mechanism comprising the shift rod 46, arm 52, shift fork 54 and actuating rod 60, where the shift lever 72 is in the front wheel driving position FF in FIG. 1b. The actuating rod 60 is in the right extreme end position, whereby the shift fork 54 is located in the right position by the snap ring 61, where the pin 71 engages the notch 63 of the actuating rod 60 and the lock ball 57 engages the notch 55 of the shift fork 54. In this position, the sleeve 58 of the synchromesh mechanism 40 is in the right position, so that the clutch device of the mechanism does not engage the gear 38. The arm 52 and shift rod 46 are also in the right position, in which the arm abuts on the stopper 74 projected from the guide plate 64 and the lock ball 50 engages the notch 48. In this position, the link 45 is in the right position, so that the shift fork 43 is actuated to shift the sleeve 41 of the synchromesh 12 of the sub-transmission S in the left direction to couple the clutch device between the gear 5 and the synchromesh 12. Thus, power of the engine is transmitted through the clutch device 2, first main drive shaft 3, gear 5 and sleeve 41 of synchromesh mechanism 12 to the second main drive shaft 10 without reduction by the sub-transmission S. The main transmission M transmits the rotation of second main drive shaft 10 to the third main drive shaft 21 by means of 4-speed transmission gear means. More particularly, if the synchromesh mechanism 20 is actuated by manipulating a shift lever (not shown) to couple the clutch device between the synchromesh mechanism and the gear 18, the third main drive shaft 21 is rotated at the lowest first speed. If the clutch device between the synchromesh mechanism and the gear 19 is engaged, the drive shaft 21 rotates at second speed. Further, engagement of the clutch device between the synchromesh mechanism 24 and the gear 22 will produce the third speed of the drive shaft 21, and engagement of the clutch device between the synchromesh mechanism and the gear 23 causes the fourth speed rotation of the drive shaft 21. The output of the drive shaft 21 is transmitted to the front axle through the gears 30 and 31 to drive the front wheel. On the other hand, since the synchromesh mechanism 40 is not in engagement position with the gear 38, the rear wheel is not driven. Thus, only front wheel is driven in the higher speed range without reduction of the sub-transmission S. When the shift lever 72 is moved to the economical four-wheel driving position (4WDe) in FIG. 1b, the actuating rod 60 is shifted in the left direction up to the intermediate position. Since the pin 71 engages the notch 63 of the actuating rod 60, the shift fork 54 is also shifted in the left direction together with the rod 60. When the shift fork 54 reaches the position of FIG. 6b, the fork is stopped by the stopper 74, where the pin 71 positions opposite the notch 66 of the guide plate 64 and the lock ball 57 engages the notch 56, resulting in the locking of the fork 54. Thus, only the shift fork 54 is moved, so that the sleeve 58 of the synchromesh mechanism 40 is shifted in the left direction to engage the gear 38. Accordingly, the shaft 34 is rotated through the third main drive shaft 21, gears 37 and 38 and sleeve 58. Since the shift rod 46 is not moved, the sub-transmission S is in the higher speed coupling state. Thus, the front and rear wheels are driven at higher speed range without reduction of the sub-transmission S. When the shift lever 72 is moved to the powerful four-wheel driving position (4WDp), the actuating rod 60 is shifted to the left extreme end position. In this operation, the fork 54 stays in the described position, the pin 71 is moved by the slant of the notch 63 to engage the notch 66. The arm 52 is moved by the snap ring 61 whereby the pin 70 is shifted by slant of the notch 65, resulting in removing from the notch 65 and engaging the notch 62 as shown in FIG. 6c. Thus, the shift rod 46 is moved together with the arm 52 and locked by engagement of the lock ball 50 with the notch 49 at the left end position. The movement of the shift rod 46 causes counter-clockwise rotation of the shift fork 43 through the link 45 thereby to move the sleeve 41 of the synchromesh mechanism 12 to bring about the engagement between the synchromesh mechanism and the gear 11. Therefore, the rotation of the first main drive shaft 3 is transmitted to the second main drive shaft 10 with the reduction by the gears 5, 7, 8 and 11. Thus, the front and rear wheels are driven at the lower speed range. In the embodiment of FIG. 7, the arm 52 and the shift rod 46 in the above mentioned embodiment are constructed into one shift rod 46a and the arm being omitted. The shift rod 46a is aligned with the actuating rod 60 which is slidably engaged with an axial hole 76 of the shift rod. The other parts are same as the prior embodiment in construction and operation and therefore, designated by same numerals as prior one. Operation of this embodiment will be easily understood from FIGS. 7a to 7c which are corresponding to FIGS. 6a to 6c. From the foregoing, it will be understood that the present invention may provide a transmission apparatus in which the engine is mounted in front side of the front axle and the sub-transmission is provided in the space formed necessarily above the front axle, whereby, since a special space for the sub-transmission is not provided, the apparatus may be manufactured in small size. Further, it is possible to drive the four-wheel drive car in the economical higher speed range and in the powerful lower speed range whereby performance of the engine may be sufficiently used under various driving conditions. * * * * *",
